Over the past week I enjoyed a break from school; where I had some time to reflect on some thoughts while not having any preoccupations. I finally finished Yuval Noah Harari's *Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow* book about the future of humanity as well as Cixin Liu's *The Three-Body Problem* science fiction novel.

After reading coming across Yuval Noah Harari's idea that the humanism that currently predominates the world's liberal view, as well as various other religions, cultures, and ideologies; will eventually be replaced by "the algorithm". This sounds speculative, but I think it's worth an understanding because it is already happening.

Current humanistic values, value the individual, and his ability to find his own paths in this world while his/her rational abilities are highly valued. In such a view human imperfections are valued and embraced, and is why humanism skeptically regards things like altering the human genome. However, the world view according to "the algorithm" doesn't clearly define the limits of tampering with biology for the sake of evolutionary superiority, or for the sake of another form of advantage.
