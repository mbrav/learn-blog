> *Investigate a system or network in the world and analyze it. What are its components and how does this system/network work?*

A system that I decided to re-investigate and reflect on, is called *infrastructure*. All modern humans can apprehend this term, but not everyone understand the term's underlying implication. *Infrastructure* is a system of the modern human being--just like capillaries are for blood, tunnels are for termites, and leafs are for trees. These are the dominant traits that extend the existential potential of individual beings and the populations that they constitute.

Modern humans have built infrastructures for water, gas, food, information, and even oxygen. These are individual systems that form a network of infrastructures. Our technocratic society combines this network of infrastructures by systemizing it using technologies. In evolutionary respects, we are superior thanks to these systems, but since we rely on them so much, we are just as vulnerable because of them. Reliances welcome vulnerabilities--just like blood becomes useless without capillaries, humans become helpless without their systems.

[Infrastructural Utopia Tower](http://www.mbrav.com/#utopia-tower.html) is an installation piece where I explore the vulnerabilities that infrastructures force us to entail.

> *Creating data, quantifying the qualitative: Data is all around us, but a lot of it is not yet ready to be seen as or called data. Find a body of qualitative properties that interests you. This could be a work of art, a piece of music, a daily activity, etc. Determine ways in which you could turn this qualitative observation or experience into data.*

The piece of data that I want to collect and examine is my sleep schedule. The categories that will be measured examine is the time I go to sleep, the quality of it, and the time I wake up. The tool that will be used to collect this data is an app called [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/). It collects that data overnight and also allows the user to export his data into a .csv file format.

The direction that I want to take with this project is to examine the poetics and harmonies behind our sleep patterns and juxtapose them with our daily schedules. Some ideas are drawn from Alexander Chen's [Conductor](https://vimeo.com/19372180) and the [visualizations of Bach's](https://vimeo.com/31179423) compositions. A more critical standpoint can also be explored which will examine the lacking qualitative and aesthetic aspect behind the collection of large amounts of data.
