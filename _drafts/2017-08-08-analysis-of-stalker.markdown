[Nietzsche, Hegel, cinema, analysis, Tarkovskii, film]

After watching *Stalker* (1979), directed by the notorious Soviet director Andrei Tarkovskii, I was moved — as one can be by any of his films — by its depth and meaning. The film can be interpreted in various ways, but for me, the film resonated a couple of important Nietzschean and Hegelian ideas.

Overall, the it can be seen how the Nietzschean dictum "God is dead", is very much prevalent in the background of Tarkovsky's work that frequently deal the subject of religion, and *Stalker* is no exclusion. A couple other points in the film are based on a Hegelian master-slave dialectic, and a couple profound points regarding aesthetic experience, particularly about Music, which very much echo Hegel's view on the subject. Music is brought up very subtly in the film, but nevertheless plays an important role since the main composer, Edward Artemiev applies music in very profound and theoretical manner using the musical tool of his time — the synthesizer. Perhaps I'll come back to music later.

The general plot of *Stalker*, is about a man who everyone calls "Stalker". He lives with his wife an daughter right near the Chernobyl reactor and makes a living by providing illegal guides to a heavily guarded place called the "the Zone". This zone, where presumably a meteorite fell, in reality is a mystical place where human wishes come true, or if better worded to the films intent — makes *wills* come true. The Writer (the character in the film) particularly emphasizes on the idea of this Nietzschean "will to power", where the wishes that people want to come true, are in actuality nothing but human *wills* — the pure element of human determination that has always caused catastrophy, wars, conflicts, and harm to nature — especially at a time after the Nietzschean proclamation "God is dead".

After having the Writer had a philosophical disputes with the Professor, they seem to be settled when the professor took out 20 kiloton nuclear bomb the size of a can, and announced his determination to set it off so that "the Zone" so it would no longer be accessible to malevolent human wishes and wills. Stalker outcried, expressing a trauma, as if he was the mouthpiece of "the Zone" — and to many extents he was. The determination to detonate "the Zone" is caused by the two men metaphorically embracing the death of human religion and belief.

## The Zone

But the Zone has a message to convey, and Stalker was the one who most intimately understood it and embraced it.

When the three men arrive to "the Zone", the film suddenly changes from sepia to color; signifying a form of resolution to the viewer that contrasts "the Zone" with a monotonous life outside the zone where God is dead. Stalker, asks the two men to leave him on his own while Stalker goes on to reconcile with zone.

## Character Analysis

This time, Stalker had two people to guide; a writer and a professor. The writer and the scientists form a sort of a Hegelian tension that then finds a resolution inside "the Zone" since both attempt to argue for their idea about how humankind ought to embrace the Nietzschean "will to power". Stalker on the other hand, is a subject who embraces the message of the film, who is an individual dissolved in "the Zone" itself. He embraces softness and fear, as opposed to stiffness and courage which are typical determinations of the human "will to power".

### The Writer
### The Professor
### Stalker

The movie ends with Stalker being frustrated and traumatized with the two men that paid him for his guide since they are longer able to hold any form of belief and religion towards anything, particularly towards the "the Zone". Stalker is therefore the subject that feels the trauma of the Nietzschean "God is dead" embraced in the beliefs of the two men, and perhaps, even in the beliefs of humankind as a whole.
