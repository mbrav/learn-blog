This is a collection of WebGL shaders that run on a web browser. For the most part, these shaders are reflections and meditations on the laws of nature and physics, expressed through a computer graphic language. Imitating natural patterns with computer code is a very abstracted and intangible process. This process was also an attempt to explore the mechanistic and voided world of computation inspired by the perplexities of quantum theory and the allegory that binds it with the [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis). As computers become the middle grounds for establishing human understanding about the world, they also give birth to ideas that make us believe that our reality is just a simulation. This was a background thought through out the duration of this alienated form of mediated expression.
