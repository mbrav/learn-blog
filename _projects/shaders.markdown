This is a collection of WebGL shaders that run on a web browser. For the most part, these shaders are reflections and meditations on the laws of nature and physics, expressed through a computer graphic language. Imitating natural patterns with computer code is a very abstracted and intangible process.

This was an exploratory process which explored the mechanistic and voided world of computers and the perplexities of quantum theory and its allegory that binds it with the [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis).

As computers increasingly become the middle grounds for establishing human understanding about the world, they also give birth to ideas that make us believe that our reality is just a simulation. This was a background thought that I had throughout out the duration of this alienated form of mediated expression. The ultimate stance in these explorations is that the greatest thing that one can do in life is to enjoy one's present existent condition disregarding whether it is "real" or not. The realness of the present is a question that does not have a meaningful answer. The greatness of life, is to enjoy what is already there, the present.
