# My Personal / Portfolio Site

I like having a fully customizable personal website, so this is the result. Hope it goes well.

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Theme based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

### Instructions

First, make sure you have ruby installed, then install jekyll like so

`gem install jekyll bundler`

Clone the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/mbrav/mbrav.github.io`

Then do

`cd mbrav.github.io`

Then install all the ruby dependencies like so

`bundle install`

Then serve the website:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

The you should be able to access on your `http://localhost:4000`

**For reference:**

`git submodule foreach git pull (origin master)`
