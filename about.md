Hello friend,

This is an experimental blog about my learning process as a BFA Design & Technology student at Parsons School of Design. Visitors are welcome (especially extraterrestrials). The medium of this blog emphasizes on the elaboration of ideas and thoughts. It also supports the democratization of knowledge, but who even wants knowledge these days?
