<p><img src="/images/head2.jpg" id="portrait" alt="" /> Hi, this is Michael üëãüèº</p>

Michael is a interdisciplinary philosophy student. His [past works](http://mbrav.com/works) range from creative/experimental projects to speculative new media art installations. These consisted of investigations with artistic, philosophic, and technologic contexts ‚Äî that seek to expound and reveal the contemporary human condition ‚Äî at an era of proliferating ideas that alienate subjectivity from authentic being in the world, digital technologies that transform reality into a simulacra; nihilist, political and relegious defeatism in the light of looming unstable future; death of God, imminent contradictions within neoliberalism and global capitalism, and frequent misrepresentations about the politics and systems of power that lie beneath the guise of advancing technology (data tracking, AI, social media, biotechnology, space travel, etc.)

Michael recently finished his undergraduate degree in [Design & Technology](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-design-technology/) at Parsons School of Design and is currently he is pursuing a second undergraduate degree in [Philosophy](http://www.newschool.edu/lang/philosophy/) at Eugene Lang set to be completed in May 2019. Michael's areas interests in philosophy regard philosophy *aesthetics*, *phenomenology*, *existentialism*, *epistemology*, *film theory*; ancient Greek philosophy, German Idealism, and European continental thought in general.

Michael's ultimate goal is to contribute to the cause of re-affirming collective agency in building a re-imagined egalitarian future where human (and non-human) exploitation is abolished.
