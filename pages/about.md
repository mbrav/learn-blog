<p><img src="assets/img/head.jpg" id="portrait" alt="" /> Hi, this is Michael üëãüèº</p>

Michael is a *creative technologist*, *new media artist*, and a *philosopher*. Michael‚Äôs past works range from creative/experimental web projects, to speculative new media art installations. His investigations explore the peripheries where art, philosophy, and technology meet ‚Äî a place where human nature is being actively tested ‚Äì determining the faith of the human condition and the scope through which we perceive our existence in this world. Michael seeks to investigate the state of human relations with technology; at a time of morphing environments, increasing alienation from reality, and the advent of various forms of advancing technology (data tracking, AI, social media, biotechnology, etc.) ‚Äî whose potential to conflict with humanistic values, is severely underestimated and/or ignored.

Michael is currently a student at Parsons School of Design studying BFA in [Design & Technology](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-design-technology/) along with a Liberal Arts degree in [Philosophy](http://www.newschool.edu/lang/philosophy/) at Eugene Lang. His other skills also entail creative coding using JavaScript, WebGL, [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), and [Processing](https://processing.org/); as well as [3d animation](/project/infrastructural-utopia-tower), sound effect & [music production](https://soundcloud.com/mixania), and [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mixania). He also enjoys reflecting on through [writing](/writing) and [journaling](/journals) every once in a while.
