<p><img src="assets/img/head.jpg" id="portrait" alt="" /> Hi, this is Michael üëãüèº</p>

Michael‚Äôs focuses can be defined as a *creative technologist*, *new media artist*, and *interaction designer*. Michael‚Äôs experiences range from creative/experimental web projects, to speculative new media art installations. His other skills entail creative coding with JavaScript, WebGL, openFrameworks and Processing libraries; as well as 3d animation, sound effect & music production, photography and video editing.

He is currently a student at Parsons School of Design studying BFA in [Design & Technology](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-design-technology/) along with a Liberal Arts degree in [Philosophy](http://www.newschool.edu/lang/philosophy/) at Eugene Lang. His investigations explore the peripheries where art, design, and technology meet ‚Äî a place where technologic advancements are shaping human nature more than humans themselves.

Michael's interest in these studies and explorations is to examine technology as an existential extension of the modern human being. He seeks to investigate the human condition at a time of morphing environments, evolving technologies, and the incubation of eccentric new mediums.
