<p><img src="assets/img/head.jpg" id="portrait" alt="" /> Hi, this is Michael üëãüèº</p>

Michael can be categorized as a *creative technologist*, *new media artist*, and an aspiring social skeptic, art critic, and an philosopher. Michael‚Äôs past works range from creative/experimental web projects, to speculative new media art installations. His investigations explore the peripheries where art, design, and technology meet ‚Äî a place where technology shapes human nature more predominately than humans do themselves. Michael seeks to investigate the human condition at a time of morphing environments, evolving technologies, and the incubation of eccentric new mediums.

He is currently a student at Parsons School of Design studying BFA in [Design & Technology](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-design-technology/) along with a Liberal Arts degree in [Philosophy](http://www.newschool.edu/lang/philosophy/) at Eugene Lang. His other skills also entail creative coding using JavaScript, WebGL, [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), and [Processing](https://processing.org/); as well as [3d animation]({{ site.url }}/project/infrastructural-utopia-tower), sound effect & [music production](https://soundcloud.com/mixania), [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mixania) and [video editing]({{ site.url }}/project/9x6). He also enjoys reflecting on through [writing]({{ site.url }}/studies) and [journaling]({{ site.url }}/journals) every once in a while.
