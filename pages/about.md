<p><img src="assets/img/head.jpg" id="portrait" alt="" /> Hi, this is Michael üëãüèº</p>

Michael‚Äôs focuses can be defined as a *creative technologist*, *new media artist*, and *interaction designer*. Michael‚Äôs experiences range from creative/experimental web projects, to new media art installations built on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. His other skills include creative coding using JavaScript, WebGL, openFrameworks and Processing libraries, sound effect & music production, 3d animation, photography and video editing.

He is currently a student at Parsons School of Design studying BFA Design & Technology along with a Philosophy. His investigations explore the peripheries where art, design, and technology meet ‚Äî a place where technologic advancements are shaping human nature more than humans have ever done themselves. His interest in these studies and explorations is to examine technology as an existential extension of the modern human being. He seeks to investigate the human condition at a time of morphing environments, evolving technologies, and the incubation of eccentric new mediums.
