<p><img src="assets/img/head.jpg" id="portrait" alt="" /> Hi, this is Michael üëãüèº</p>

Michael can be categorized as a *creative technologist*, *new media artist*, and an aspiring social skeptic and critic. Michael‚Äôs past works range from creative/experimental web projects, to speculative new media art installations. His other skills also entail creative coding using JavaScript, WebGL, [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), and [Processing](https://processing.org/); as well as [3d animation]({{ sit.url }}/project/infrastructural-utopia-tower), sound effect & [music production](https://soundcloud.com/mixania), [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mixania) and [video editing]({{ site.url }}/project/9x6).

He is currently a student at Parsons School of Design studying BFA in [Design & Technology](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-design-technology/) along with a Liberal Arts degree in [Philosophy](http://www.newschool.edu/lang/philosophy/) at Eugene Lang. His investigations explore the peripheries where art, design, and technology meet ‚Äî a place where technology shapes human nature more predominately than humans do themselves.

Michael's interest in these studies and explorations is to examine technology as an existential extension of the modern human being. He seeks to investigate the human condition at a time of morphing environments, evolving technologies, and the incubation of eccentric new mediums.
