excerpt: "Michael's blog, writings and journals"
---

Blog are texts/excerpts/notes that I happen to write up on any particular day for whatever purpose it might be. These are not meant to be writings of a refined level. To see my more refined writing and essays, go to [Writings]({{ site.url }}/writing).

These are writings that I dedicated my time to articulate. These can range from assignments, essays, and philosophy. I also maintain a [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog) where I keep my less elaborate writings.
