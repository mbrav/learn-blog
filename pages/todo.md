[^egg]: A modern take on George Orwell's _1984_

[^1]: Contains also his works *Antichrist*, *Thus Said Zarathustra*, etc.

[^2]: critique of, on the one hand, Christianity, nationalism and traditional morality, and on the other, humanism, utilitarianism, liberalism and much of the then-burgeoning socialist movement, advocating instead an amoral (although importantly not inherently immoral or antisocial) egoism. It is considered a major influence on the development of anarchism, existentialism, nihilism and postmodernism.**Also a source for criticism in Marx's *German Ideology***
