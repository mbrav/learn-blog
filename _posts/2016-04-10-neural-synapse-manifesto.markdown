An artist is like a neural synapse. He must rest reactive to the environment and his surroundings. As negative as the reality surrounding the artist might be, he must maintain his awareness if he wants to rest entitled as an artist. Just like a neuron must maintain healthy synapses since otherwise it becomes dysfunctional. If the artist where to become ignorant of his awareness, his function as an artist and that of a healthy neuron â€” becomes falsified.

The most common way that an artist can become a falsification of his intended function, is when his beliefs become dictated by the environment. Since an artist is like a neuron, he must not allow his neural synapses get clogged with the abundant amounts of dust that the environment is filled with. It should also be within the artist's ability to notice when the environment is making an attempt to stimulate his neural synapses for the sake of manipulating his inner values. Many individuals have succumbed to this manipulation and it is the artist's most important function to raise this awareness. A neuron with healthy synapses must strive to maintain his alertness, especially when other neurons become un-alert after allowing their synapses to become subjects of stimuli.

It is important to outline that although a neuron might seem like a biologic mechanism that easily reacts to the environment, it nevertheless reacts more naturally than a neural whose synapses have been clogged with dust. Moreover, the reactions of a neuron to the environment cannot be predicted with complete accuracy when it is healthy. The reactions of neuron whose synapses are clogged on the other hand, are more predictable.

Since the most important and valuable function of any artist is to criticize the general public with the help of his creativity, when he is succumbed into the ways of the general public, his synapses become clogged with dust. As the dust settles in the artist's synapse, his ability to react to the environment as a healthy neuron, decreases and so does his creativity. An experienced artist however, will be wise enough to know when this dust starts settling and therefore avoid it and continue to raise awareness of it presence.

Settling dust however, is not the most frightening thing than can happen to an artist, for it can also happen due to old age. A more common and frightening thing that an artist should fear is when his synapses are attempted to be stimulated. More often than not, an artist has built enough awareness to notice this, but paranoia is what pushes him to raise the awareness for others. It is important for the artist to take notice of this awareness sooner rather than later.

An artist deserves praise when despite the pain and suffering caused from looking at the reality from a mirror-like perspective, he maintains his sobriety. A normal person in the artist's place would not maintain the same level of sobriety and would eventually succumb to the standards that he once was resilient towards. Although the paranoia that pushes the artist can prove to be exceptionally potent, at times it can prove to be overwhelming as well. Those artists who learn to direct their paranoia into their art are masters, those who go through intense suffering and still manage to express it, are praised masters.

Indeed, some great artists have not been able to maintain their sobriety and fell into great depression. But when such artists manage to rise back, their work although might at times become considered controversial, this nevertheless makes them artist with strong neural synapses.
