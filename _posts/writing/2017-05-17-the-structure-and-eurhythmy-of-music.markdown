![Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 1770-1831](http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hegel-phenomenology.jpg)

The aim of this paper is to characterize music’s inner and temporal resolutions devised in the balance among the harmonies and relations among its notes. The subdivision of bars and beats into notes according to the laws of structure, proportion, and harmony— draws multiple connections to the structural organization that can be found in architecture, sculpture, and painting. The subdivision of _caesura_ (meaning verse in Greek) into syllables and vowels; the positioning of sculptures and architecture according to the laws of symmetry and visual harmony[^1]—are strikingly similar to the way in which music is devised and arranged according to bars, beats, and notes. The characteristics of music aimed to be demonstrated in this essay, are twofold; first point, concerns music's potential to express a soul and its inner spirit which becomes embodied in the beholder’s subjectivity, despite the medium’s temporal characteristics. What might initially seem as a irresolution on music’s behalf, especially when compared to the non-temporal features of sculpture and architecture, in actuality, allows music to express features that are extensively theoretical and ideal. The second part of this essay, concerns music's capacity to elevate itself above _its own_ laws of symmetry, structure, beat, etc., and achieve an incomparable level of expression of soul and emotion—to which, a relation to poetry will be drawn.

## Music's Expression Albeit its Temporality

The first point concerns music’s embodiment of an absolute form despite the temporal and self-annihilating features of its auditory medium. Despite the temporality of its characteristics, music is nevertheless able to persist in the beholder's memory and inner subjectivity. The notes contained in music are meant to be reproducible as a tune in memory and it is what makes its spirit easily replicable in the soul of an individual.[^2] This characteristic becomes evident in music, especially when compared to medium of painting—where in order for the beholder to sufficiently grasp the painting’s inner spirit and content, he/she must stand in front of the painting in the _present_ _moment_. Music on the other hand, can be actualized in memory at almost any time after its initial conception, which however, is most frequently not a recollection of the melody in its complete exactness, but nevertheless is a sufficient recollection of the melody’s spirit and emotion. The structure of the music beat, is what gives objectivity to music, but does not prevent music to reveal and expound its inner life. This is what allows a musical piece to exist on its own account, as opposed to a romantic painting, which although does reveal the inner life as an ideal with "a subjective passions and feeling of character and heart", it nevertheless remains preoccupied with the sphere of its own circumstances, aims, and actions. As Hegel states, no matter how much one plunges to admire a work of art and understand its subject-matter, "it is all in vein", because although what is depicted become independently persistent objects, our relation to them never gets beyond the vision of them as eye gazers and spectators.[^10] When a beholder recollects a melody, it is for this reason that such a recollection is rarely that of notes in their bare structural form, but one which is theoretical and emotional. These recollections are deeply emotional, but at the same time, theoretical conceptions of the melodic play among notes—which quite paradoxically, emerges out of strictly devised structure and composition.

When compared to the visual arts, music expresses object-free inner life that is ideally and theoretically elaborated in what Hegel refers to as “abstract subjectivity”[^3]. This form of theoretical elaboration contrasts with the form of expression devised in other forms of art—whose subject-matter is most often contingent to something physical and external. Music is a form of romantic art that withdraws from the expression of external life, and becomes an expression of inner life in its own subjectivity—which Hegel refers to as the “unfolding” of music’s Absolute ideal. This unfolding of the ideal, consists of unraveled and expounded subject-matter that occurs throughout the duration of a melody. The subject-matter inherent in a melody consists of an interplays, relations, oppositions, conflicts, transitions, complications, and resolutions; which constitute a melody’s subject-matter, as well as the inner life and character of almost every individual note. Music of high vocation does not just replicate the natural outburst of passionate notes, but is transformed into a theoretical expression that reveals specific notes and their relations to other notes.[^6] At the same time however, even when compared to romantic painting, music gains a more theoretical ground for spirited expression due to its objective and structural foundation, but whose essence nevertheless unfolds as something profoundly subjective.[^4]

Along with sight, hearing is one of the only two theoretical senses, contrary to the more practical ones such as taste, touch, and smell. For Hegel however, hearing is more ideal than sight because sound as such, is a sphere in which a complete cancellation of materiality is possible.[^5] Within the sphere of sound, music is given a medium in which its ideal content and high spiritedness can unfold. This can be contrasted with architecture and sculpture, which struggle to idealize their ideal content while accounting for every one of its three physical dimensions. Painting, in relation to architecture and sculpture, achieves a more ideal form of actualization of its inner content due to the negation of one of these dimensions, making it a two-dimensional medium. Music on the other hand, negates and strips away the physicality of all these dimensions altogether, which no longer interfere with the actualization of its profoundly theoretical, absolute, and ideal qualities. The only dimension in which music can assert its existence—is _time_, which Hegel refers to as a "sphere" and not a dimension. The musical interplay among the notes unfolds exactly within this sphere.

Like painting, music proceeds to present the inner life as objective content—structure, beat, harmony, in the case of music; and ideal figures in the case of painting—but still leaves the content in its immediate self-sufficiency and absolute subjectivity without a contingent externality.[^902] Subjective feeling is what music claimed as its own subject-matter. This is what allows music to capture and expand the feelings that fall under other mediums; such as awe and worship in symbolic art; love, mourning, grief in painting; and misery, lament, sorrow in poetry. These are feelings that are profoundly embodied and expressed in music, which makes it a great addition to other works of art due to its ability to trigger and actualize these emotions. This makes music a medium that is heartfelt, giving it the ability to trigger the shed of tears, joy, etc., in a manner that is incomparable to any other medium.[^935] Music can therefore be incorporated with other forms of art to the advantage of both sides. When for example, music is accompanied with poetry to produce drama, it brings to our soul the feelings that are attempted to be expressed solely through poetry, but which become fully actualized in along with music. Here, poetry is the _elucidating interpreter_ of ideas and thoughts for us to apprehend and reproduce, and music presents these feelings as subject-matter through the use of notes, that inwardize and accompany the poetic work itself to produce a work of drama.[^904]

## Music's Expression of its Inherent Structure

The second point of this essay, is to characterize music's ability to express its profoundly subjective expression out of a relatively strict structure. As mentioned beforehand, the seemingly paradoxic qualities in music, lies precisely in its ability to produce spirited expression out of structured laws of proportion and rhythm. Other mediums such as architecture, hold rules of a structural organization that are similarly strict, but come nowhere close in expressing their inner subjectivity. Music’s high vocation lies exactly in the fact that it overcomes the constraints of _its own_ medium—let alone the inherent constraints of dimensionality and materiality that other mediums evidently struggle with, but _cannot_ overcome—allows music to expound its theoretical profoundness as an art of _highest_ vocation.

But structure is nevertheless something that music has to overcome, balance and figure out: when an executant artist plays a musical work, he must become obedient to the instrument and must not improvise as it will spoil the performance.[^7] On the other hand, the performer must not express his work in a purely mechanical fashion and must "give life and soul to the work in the same sense that the composer intended to give, and not give an impression of being a musical automaton who recites a mere lesson and repeats mechanically what has been dictated to him." Here, Hegel’s refers to _Genius_ as something who is accounted only when the performer manages to reach the "spiritual height" of bringing the composer's work to life. This spiritual height here lies precisely in the virtuoso’s ability to unravel, execute, and expound the inner relations, oppositions, conflicts, etc. that occur among the notes.

These expressions triggered by music however, are not derivatives of sensuous material, nor a direct reaction based on physical vibration and other forms of externalities, but an ideal expression within the sphere of _time_.[^904] Because music cannot rely on anything external due its theoretical and temporal nature, it nurtures a spirited enrichment that it then needs to find an accompanying mode of expression in order to convey its inner soul as ideal content, before it annihilates itself within the sphere of time. Both, music and poetry gain an advantage when dealing with the auditory temporality of sound, where a steady flux of time must be apprehended according to some form of _unit_. In music, these units are notes, which succeed one after another according to the rules of structure, relation, harmony, tension, etc. This is what constitutes music's object-free inwardness consisting of musical notation, bars, beats, etc.—which again, according to music’s paradoxical nature; form its objective foundations, as well as its absolute subjectivity and inner content.

[^904]: Hegel, p.904
[^1016]: Hegel, p.1016

Music’s time-measure which consists of a bar, beat and tempo, serve as the melody’s foundations of regularity on top of which the melody’s inner qualities can unfold. This structural definition draws similarities to classical Greek architecture—where the columns of the same thickness must be placed alongside one another with devised principle of equality.[^8] Music borrows some of the successes achieved in the Greek columns in terms of devising methods of order and structure (whether this was deliberate or not). One of these is namely, the laws of symmetry and _eurhythmy_[^9] (deriving from Greek roots meaning beautiful or harmonious rhythm), except that music is not actualized in an external object and is the reason why its ideal content can only be expressed temporally.

Another medium with which music shares it temporal and structural characteristics, is poetry. Between these two mediums, Hegel mentions that the most prominent distinction between them, is _beat_. Poetry in relation to music is not constrained to the repetitive time measures that are fixated for the most part in music.[^1017] The rhythmical time-measure in poetry, does however introduce a form of accent and _caesura_ (verse in Greek) which corresponds to what is recognized in music as the rhythmical beat. The manner in which long syllables become more accented and important than the shorter ones, forms the intricate structure of the poetic work. The relation to melodic notes is expounded when the accent is put on shorter syllables, which can emphasize them relative to the longer ones. (Hegel, p. 1018) This structural and relational quality in poetry, highlights once again its similarities with musical structure, while also hinting on poetry's immense dependance on the structures devised in music.

[^1017]: Hegel, p. 1017

Events in a poetic work become verses, and uttered words are passed over as vowels and syllables which allow them to resemble musical notes. This is one of the forms of poetic expressions that Hegel’s refers to as _rhythmic versification_. This form of versification is what gives a poetic work its metre, rhyme, and tempo—all which help the poetic work to expound itself within it inherent structure. This reliance on structure resembles the music’s structural objective foundations, and the manner in which they unfold to present the subjectivity and inner content of a melody. This relation can be noted in particular among the sonorities of European languages, in which vowels and syllables gain a function that is similar to the musical note. Hegel emphasizes that in Latin nations, particularly among the Spaniards, have the necessary sonorous language that is fitted for the reassurance of the same vowels (a, e, i, o, u), which gives a poetic work an additional leverage to its rhythmical qualities. This is the relation that music shares with poetry—where vowels and syllables are subjected to rules that are comparable to the manner in which the subject-matter of a melody, consists of interplays, relations, and oppositions.

[^1011]: Hegel, p. 1011
[^1030]: Hegel, p. 1030

At the same time, Hegel makes an emphasis on the way sound is treated in music in relation to how sound is treated in poetry. In particular, Hegel mentions how in music, the sonorities of the human organ of speech are meticulously expounded, but not in poetry, where the organ of speech is used in a way that is other than something musical—as a "mere token of word", which acquires value only as something indicative, meaningless in itself.[^18] Although the vowels and syllables in poetry do consist of elaborated relations among their tones and accents, they are primarily adjusted for the translation of speech, which impose limits on the extents of which the sonorities of an organ of speech is able to reach an idealized stage. Contrary to poetry, which treats sound as something subservient to speech, music takes sound as a separate independent medium, and makes it possible to treat it as something independent in itself.[^19]

<!-- To conclude

END

It it is mostly argued by Hegel that Music gains its full potential when accompanied with poetry to produce an opera. It also seems that poetry also gains structure in the resulting dramatic work as well. Hegel does say that poetry frees itself from the rules of harmony which music is constrained to. Hegel here, does not talk about structure, but the sensuous aspect of music that poetry is not constrained to.(Hegel, p. 1013) This _rhythmic versification_ of poetry depends on temporal progress just like music, and it is what makes music such a good addition to poetry. In section that concerns poetic rhyme, Hegel mentions how it versification approaches the measurements that are intrinsic to music, as opposed to the "stuffiness" of language composed of mere longs and shorts.(Hegel, 1023) Hegel praises Greek poetry for developing a form of versification that is most beautiful and richly developed:

This type of versification doesn't take for its material the sound as such of letter, syllables, or words, but the sound of syllables in their temporal duration, and so the result in that our attention in not to be exclusively directed to single syllables, or words, but the sound of syllables in their temporal duration, and so the result is that our attention is not exclusively directed to single syllables, letters or to the qualitative similarity or identity of their sound.(Hegel, p. 1026)

But on the contrary, Hegel suggests that the sound of the verse remains in an undivided unity with the tempo and follows the law regulating the rhythmic progress of the ensemble. Even the emphasis on specific syllables, is not just an ordinary accentuation, but one that also embodies metrical accent and rhythm—a play on sound and structure that music appertains to music as such. In fact, various versifications that depend on rhyme, gain a very poor and imperfect quality when syllables create one-letter rhymes which insist of the repetition of one and same letter. This type of rhyme does not demand the recurrence, tension, and relational structure of the same syllable that can be achieved with profundity within music's temporal medium.(Hegel, p. 1029)

Speech is made into music of feeling and a melodic symmetry, not of time measure and rhythmic movement, bit of sound, which is clearly echoed in the inner life's inner feeling.(Hegel, p. 1031)

Poetry

**Note:** Knox mentions in the footnotes that Hegel might be referring to Schubert and Beethoven. However, Glenn Gold argues that even Bach was already achieving profound successes by creating music that is highly spirited regardless on which an instrument it is played.

Hegel believes that Music is not just added as an accompaniment to the libretto, but the other way around. The text itself has no worth other than creating a better idea of what the artists has chosen to be the subject of his work.[11]() The medium that music masters is a medium that is other than the perception of ideas—it is the medium of conveying the inner life; which can be both the expression of subjective feeling, as well as what Hegel refers to as an _ideal significance_.[12]()

The subject-matter These preoccupations are mostly absent in music, except when accopanied with a libretto to produce drama.[13]()

**Music is not like paining or sculpture which express the spirit of an artwork through the human posture and facial expression, in other words, forms that are derived from externally existent forms. Instead, music borrows some of the successes that where achieved in architecture, particularly by the Greek columns and namely, the laws of symmetry and eurhythmy[**14**](), except that music is not actualized in an external object and is the reason why its ideal content can only be expressed in a temporal form.**

Unlike other forms of art, music cannot be consumed nor destroyed. [15]() This form of enrichment is what is worked out and achieved by Bach.

The manner in which music forms as spirited expression out of objective laws of symmetry, structure, beat, etc. is through the act of modulation and transformation.[16]() Out of these, unfold more profound and spirited relations, oppositions, conflicts, transitions, complications, snd resolutions.[17]()

1. What does Hegel have to say about the Echo of music? Is an Echo to music like shade is to architecture. Chiaroscuro?—Music has an Echo, sign of Spirit? Architecture has a shade which is a sign of superficial spirit?

Musical Notes as Structure for Poetry

Besides being a medium for heartfelt emotion, music also give structure and reification to the poetic work.

It resembles as a mutual parasitic relationship that is benevolent for both parties.

The figures of sculptures and architecture follow the laws of symmetry and visual harmony in the extension of space, which remains static for the most part.[20]()

_-Beauty, for Baumgarten, has more to do with rational ideas such as harmony, rather than with what is physiological.-_[_-21-_]()

Architectural structure

1. Greek Columns

1.1. The tule that they follow when placed next to one another, proportion in thickness, height etc.

Ideal significance

An example is drawn from the the _Crucfixus_, where divine suffering and death is not treated as a dedication of subjective emotion and sympathy, but a profundity that moves through suffering and their melody. The libretto therefore sets the setting by relating an event to another, sets the feelings into words, and music is what actualizes the setting that was set by the libretto which causes a heartfelt feeling which stimulates the shed of tears, joy, etc.[22]()

On the other hand, music is something that is elevates the soul above its feeling in which it is immersed, and convey it as something absolute along with a pure sense of self.[23]() Music therefore acquires a characteristic as a natural production without any specific subject-matter, just like a bird that "sings cheerfully and touchingly just in order to sing". **Although a bird might be singing for a biological purpose that it itself is not aware of, its expression can be referred to be as a liberation (even if one attempts to reduce a bird into a clump of biologic matter or atomistic constituents, music is a liberation from such objectivity), just like music liberates and embodies a sense even if it is part of the beats, measures and others rules of music**. In other words, music embodies an inner soul.

An Epic is where the poet intends to unfold an objective world of events and ways of action. It recounts deeds and events in favor of the individual personality.[24]()

Glenn Gold on Bach

1. The idea of North gould (Paul's suggestion)

The artipuque

Bach was way too involved with structure to even worry about things like the materiality of an instrument. [25]() "The artipique" was recorded in any combination of structure; wind wing cortes orchestras, brass cortets, and even saxophone cortets.[26]() There are two types of composers; ones who think they will create something unprecedented revelation of a instrument's potential in a way that no one has ever done before, then there are the ones who say they will create a piece that "will have as much meaning to the eye as to the ear" and allow you to invent sonorities that don't even exist yet.[27]() Bach was writing his composition at a time where everyone was heading towards the opposite end of composition; hedonistic and instrumental display. Bach focuses on the _inner_ instead of the _outer_.[28]()

Chromatic Fantasia

An example of Bach as an improviser, and opposed to back as a composer.

Leonard Bernstein and Gold on Bach

[Glenn Gould and Leonard Bernstein]()

During the time of Bach, composers were not as transparent about the ways in which their masterpieces must be played. There were "a pitiful few clues about the performance".[29]() There were "alegro"—fast, "piano" - slow and a few signs making the notes smooth or terse. But then there would be not a single sign about the dynamics.

This is similar to Shakesphere, who was also not as transparent about the way his works should be performed. Such as _Hamlet_, as an example. There is no description of the set, there is a list of _Dramatis Personae_, and then the play starts with Bernardo following the title "Act I, Scene I". There is no description about the height or the characteristics of the people. The only way is to study the characters and get a feel for their characteristics. Just like it is with getting the _inner_ life of a compost ion out of strict mathematical laws of musical composition. -->
