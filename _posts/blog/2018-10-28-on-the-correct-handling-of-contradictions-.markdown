## Two Types of Contradictions Differing in Nature

**Two types of contradictions**

- Between the people and the enemy
- Among people

The definitions of people and the enemy:

- **People** (internal): The mass; those who, together united, fought against Japanese and U.S. imperialists.
- **Enemies** (external): Those who resist the socialist revolution which includes the U.S imperialists and their running dogs, the bureaucrat-capitalists, the landlords, etc. These frequently introduce counter-revolutionaries in order to cause contradiction among the people.   

The contradictions with the enemies are *antagonistic* for the most part, while the contradictions among the people (through different classes such as the peasantry, intelegentsia, working class and peasantry, etc.) are both, of an *antagonistic* as well as a non-*antongonisitc* character. The People’s Government represents the people’s interests, but there are contradictions that arise out of this representation nevertheless, which are the following:

- Interests of the **state** and interests of the **collective**
- Interests of **democracy** and interests of **centralism**
- Between **leadership** and the **led**

Although the *national bourgeoisie* differs from of imperialists and landlords:
> “The  contradiction between  the  national  bourgeoisie  and  the  working  class  is  one  between  exploiter  and  exploited,  and  is  by  nature  antagonistic.”

This internal contradiction can eventually resolve into a contradiction that is of an “*enemy*” (external) kind if not handled properly. The way this must be handled is by criticizing and educating the *national bourgeoisie* and is thus a way of dealing with internal contradictions.

The questions of *right* and *wrong* is more clear in the case of the enemy, but not as clear in the case of contradictions among the people:
> For  example,  the  question  of  who  is  in  the  right,  we  or  the  domestic  and  foreign  reactionaries,  the imperialists,  the  feudalists  and  bureaucrat-capitalists,  is  also  one  of  right  and  wrong,  but  it  is  in  a  different  category  from  questions  of  right and wrong among the  people.

These internal contradictions among the people can be resolved the proletariat exercising their dictatorship over the *national bourgeoisie* which is the fundamental aspect of “people's  democratic dictatorship”. This means that:   
The  People's  Republic  of  China  enjoy  freedom  of  speech,  the  press,  assembly,  association, procession,  demonstration,  religious  belief,  and  so  on.”

But this guidance is not anarchic in the sense that it accords with the interests or wishes of the people. It is a democracy under a *centralized guidance*, a “freedom with leadership”. This frequently leads people to think that a people’s democracy entails less freedom than a Western parliamentary democracy. They ask for a two-party system where one takes the lead and the other stand in oppositions. “But  this  so-called  two-party  system  is  nothing  but  a  device  for  maintaining  the  dictatorship  of  the  bourgeoisie;  it  can  never guarantee  freedoms  to  the  working  people.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  freedom  and  democracy  exist  not  in  the  abstract,  but  only  in  the  concrete.”

Ideological questions must be resolved democratically, through a method of persuasion, discussion, criticism, and not by the method of coercion or repression. This goes under the formula epitomized in 1942 “unity—criticism—unity”:
> This  democratic  method  of  resolving  contradictions  among  the  people  was  epitomized  in  1942  in  the  formula  "unity  --  criticism  -unity".  To  elaborate,  that  means  starting  from  the  desire  for  unity,  resolving  contradictions  through  criticism  or  struggle,  and  arriving  at  a new  unity  on  a  new  basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Through the step of criticisms, one deconstructs things into what is *right* and *wrong* and re-integrates them back into the unity. Through this method of education and democracy, criticism and self-criticism become an crucial part of people’s democratic dictatorship.

Contradictions exist everywhere in nature and universe, and Marxist philosophy holds that *unity* consists of two parts being in constant struggle which compels things to change and eventually find unification. But contradictions between a *socialist society* and that of a *capitalist society* are of two different natures:
> Contradictions  in  socialist  society  are  fundamentally  different  from  those  in  the  old  societies,  such  as  capitalist  society.  In  capitalist society  contradictions  find  expression  in  acute  antagonisms  and  conflicts,  in  sharp  class  struggle;  they  cannot  be  resolved  by  the  capitalist system  itself  and  can  only  be  resolved  by  socialist  revolution.  The  case  is  quite  different  with  contradictions  in  socialist  society;  on  the contrary, they are  not  antagonistic  and can be  ceaselessly resolved by the  socialist  system  itself.

The contradictions between the people is therefore of a socialist kind which can be resolved through persuasion and democratic activity. It is a contradiction like that of any kind that can be found in the universe, which perpetuates change and resolves into unity. These contradictions can be solved from *within* the socialist system, while contradictions in a capitalist society cannot be resolved from within it, and therefore perpetuate an eventual dissolution. This is the fundamental difference.

Therefore, contradictions among the people are of a natural kind, that can be resolved through persuasion and discussion.

##  The Question of Eliminating the Counter-Revolutionaries

The Question of elimination concerns internal, as well external struggles with the enemy. Frequently, people who constitute the internal contradiction would start becoming sympathetic to the ideas of the enemy. Although the primary reason why the Liberation Army exists is because people are tempered in decades of revolutionary struggle, the process of eliminating Counter-Revolutionaries is an important reason for the consolidation of our state.

The elimination of counter-revolutionaries becomes “absolutely necessary”:
> After  liberation,  we  rooted  out  a  number  of  counter-revolutionaries.  Some  were  sentenced  to  death  for  major  crimes.  This  was absolutely  necessary,  it  was  the  demand  of  the  masses,  and  it  was  done  to  free  them  from  long  years  of  oppression  by  the  counterrevolutionaries  and  all  kinds  of  local  tyrants,  in  other  words,  to  liberate  the  productive  forces.

However, mistakes have been made in eliminating the counter-revolutionaries. Some where eliminated preemptively and with excess, in other cases, some revolutionaries “slipped through our net”. This act of eliminating the counter-revolutionaries is the *mass line*, but is is always subject to criticism since it is also prone to committing mistakes. But it becomes necessary since counter-revolutionaries are always being instrumentalized by the enemy such by the U.S Imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek, in order to instigate contradiction within the mass. This is why it always necessary to stay alert and Aware of such threats, even if the number of counter-revolutionaries has been drastically reduced since 1956—the struggle continues.
