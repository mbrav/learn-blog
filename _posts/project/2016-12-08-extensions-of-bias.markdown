[Additional Notes]({{ site.url }}/journal/2016/12/08) about the process

*A speculative new media art installation about how media technology is becoming a mediation of our biases.*

The installation consists of 4 Raspberry Pi's that connect to Twitter, scrape for tweets based on a specific keyword, and read it using text-to-speech. Each of the four nodes choose a random keyword from a set of categories every 2 minutes; *politics*, *science*, *ideology*, *technology*, *consumerism*, *memoirs*, and *celebreties*. The idea behind this process, is to exaggerate the [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) that we enjoy exercising as users of media technology.  

## Narrative

The destiny of the romantic relationship among humans and technology is certain – technology is becoming less of a tool, and more of a prosthesis that is actively shaping the human condition and agency. But what does this 'marvelous' and 'empowering' technology bring? Along the biases that are already inherent in biologic human nature, how can technology augment our immensely biased natures? Are we using technology as an instrument that expands our rationality, or are we creating bubbles of opinions and prejudices that we endlessly affirm and entertain — chasms that become desolated from rationality.

Human biases have become the inherent products of digital capitalism and consumer societies, products that are becoming increasingly inconspicuous to human awareness as they hardwire the human consciousness. Human bias is a catalyst for the instrumentality of mass sensation, desire, marketing, and political sentiment. It is the equivalent of a nervous system that is being actively stimulated with electrodes, distracting the mind from thinking sanely.

Too little information is viewed as a deprivation from freedom of speech, but too much information, to an extent that it becomes imperceptible, is frequently not reckoned as such. But distraction is the key instrumentality of *bias*; it easily breeds control, subversion, and indirect manipulation. Excessive abundance of information transforms rationality into an oblique signal, fainted by news about Taylor Swift’s sex life, the new iPhone, and a politician’s hair style, etc. But the information that surfaces and reaches the viewer, is based on the ideologic intents of either the global Silicone Valley, or insurgent AI algorithms that no human fully understands.

As humanity invents new emergent forms of media consumption, we also embrace the biases that are adherent to these mediums. Mass media feeds, corporate endorsement, rhetoric, and undigested ideologies — are served to the human consciousness through the arteries of digital media. While we condition ourselves to trust and embrace these technologies, we are also conditioning an increasingly biased human nature.
