After finishing reading *Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software* by Steven Johnson, and *Adversarial Design* by Carl DiSalvo, I started to think about a project that incorporates some of themes that are explored in the readings.

What I found interesting in the concept of *emergence*, is how complex behaviors emerge from simple organization. In Johnson's terms, emergence is a "movement from low-level rules to higher-level sophistication"[^j1]. In nature we can see how various systems like ant colonies form very complex systems that emerge from relatively simple behaviors. But with ants in particular, it is interesting to note how each of them individually is linked to a collective network of a swarm. The ant colony emerges into a sort of a conscious organism which becomes aware of it’s internal health and economy of sorts. This also allows ants to proactively respond to dangers that threaten the whole colony by interfacing directly with the swarm’s network.

This led me to think about how humans can develop a collective network that is as effective as the one of ants. We are linked through a network called the Internet, but we are not as sophisticatedly integrated into it. Although we use powerful electronic devices to interface with the internet using high-bandwidth speeds, we use our low-bandwidth biological limbs to interact with these devices. This translates into a human incapability to communicate through thought, intuition, and collective perception.

I started to think about how we can integrate our behavior so that we can proactively respond to treats just like ants. At an age of climate change and multiple humanitarian crises, these might be a traits that are worth introducing. This is where Carl DiSalvo’s *Adversarial Design* served as as a direction point. What is particularly interesting about the notion of adversarial design, is that it probes social and political issues with the help so called “ubicomp” devices[^d1]. These are devices that are integrated into human behavior that allow environmental and social problems to become more perceptible. I decided to think of a device that manifests certain aspects of adversarial design in order re-design certain human behavior.

## The Feedback Mechanism of Our Brain

In Johnson’s *Emergence* I was intrigued by his own experience when visiting the doctor to examine his adrenaline system[^j2]. At the end of the session, the doctor complemented Johnson for having a healthy adrenaline system except for the six or seven dramatic spikes that occurred on the graph. Each of the spikes corresponded to the jokes that Johnson made during session. The doctor mentioned that these spikes signify a healthy relationship between his adrenaline system and natural instinct. But Johnson’s objective conclusion for these adrenalin spikes is quite startling. He concluded that he was “addicted” to jokes because they caused a dose of adrenaline to be released into his bloodstream. Johnson’s brain enjoys this small adrenaline rush and is what caused  Johnson to become “addicted” to making jokes. This addiction in turn, formed a part of his personality that describes him as an individual who enjoys making jokes.

Adrenaline together with serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, among a dozen other types of hormones and substances, function as a reward system of the brain. Based on the actions we make, we are rewarded with certain levels of these substances. Different combinations of these produce more complex forms of emotions. But getting used to a particular action means that our brain is substance dependent. This substance dependency is what forms the complex *feedback mechanisms* of our complex personalities. Our unconscious behavior is almost entirely dependent on these feedbacks.

## Substance Rewarding Device

The realization that the brain is substance dependent, led me to think about ways to take advantage of these *feedback mechanisms*. That is, train ourselves to follow certain practices that we fail to consider in our conscious decisions. The conscious decisions that we might want to become better train are the ones that benefit the enviorment. These include picking up trash, compartmentalizing waste, or decreasing our consumerist habits. To do so, it is necessary to create a device that rewards our brain with a *positive feedback* and *negative feedback* substances. In other words, we can take advantage of our brain’s substance addiction and re-design our behavior to be more environmentally friendly. Just like Johnson is addicted to jokes, we can train ourselves to become addicted to actions than are beneficial to the social collective and environment.

In order to take advantage of the human *reward system* it is necessary to effect the brain with the help of a particular substance. That is, release it into the body’s bloodstream. But some sort of a device be attached to a subject’s body is necessary for such a feat. Devices that release substances into the bloodstream already exist in а form of insulin implants that are actively used by diabetics. By injecting insulin into a diabetics’s bloodstream, the device does not alter the behavior of the patient, but does provides an important functionality for the patient’s health.

I began thinking of ways how to feasibly experiment with a device that can somehow release substances into my bloodstream in a controlled manner. By controlling the moment when the substance gets released, I can create a device that analyzes my actions based on how beneficial they where to the social collective and the environment. If it registers an action that benefited the environment, it will release a substance. My brain will then become addicted to this substance, while I develop an urge to satisfy this addiction by making environmentally friendly decisions.

I have looked at a few brave experimenters who [inserted a biochip implant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIiP1H3Opw) under their skin. While I take it as an inspiration, I don’t think the benefits would outnumber the health hazards that such an experiment can pose. But those aside, such a device seems like an effective solution.

But instead of injecting substances into my bloodstream directly, I can think of some other ways that I can do so with safer methods. I thought about substances that people are addicted to, such as nicotine, sugars, and alcohol. What if I expose myself to these substances based on how good my behavior is? What if I train myself to do certain actions by becoming addicted to one of these substances?

Electronic cigarets seemed to be an intriguing option. Especially since the global population contains a significant portion of its population that smokes. It would certainly be safer to build a device that functions based on a commonly used product as apposed to using a hazardous syringe. What if I use the electronic cigarette to release nicotine smoke based on how environmentally friendly my behavior is?

I started thinking about a device that can be worn. I sketched out device that would be worn as a backpack. There would also be a hat with 4 cameras and an embed computer that will analyze my actions. Whenever it the device registers a beneficial action, it will release a rewarding dose of smoke containing nicotine.

The device will incorporate a breathing mechanism. While wearing it, I will inhale and exhale the outside air as normal normally. But whenever I commit a beneficial action to the environment, I get rewarded with a dose of nicotine. My substance dependency will drive my brain’s decisions that benefit my environment. We should all take advantage of our substance dependencies and use them to the benefiting of our environments. Such a submission is voluntary to the user.
