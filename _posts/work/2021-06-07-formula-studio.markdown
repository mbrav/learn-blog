A CMS for yoga and fitness studios written in Django.

The aim of this project is to create a CMS for managing subscriptions, single visits and purchases for gyms, yoga studios. This project is a result of frustration with available expensive CMS services, while open source variants seem to be very complex with functionality that I did not need anyways. It is largely a learn-as-you go along process, given that this is my fist Django App. But this software is already being actively used as the main accounting tool at one studio in Russia, [Formula Yoga](https://www.formulayoga.com/).
