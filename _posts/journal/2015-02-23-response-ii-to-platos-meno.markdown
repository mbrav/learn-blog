By questioning Meno's servant, Socrates proved that humans have opinions entitled to them since the moment of their birth. These opinions can lead to right conclusions in the same way as knowledge can lead to right conclusions. The servant showed that he had opinions in him but not the knowledge that supports his opinions. Nevertheless, this did not aggravate the servantâ€™s ability to give correct answers to Socrates's questions. After Socrates proved that Meno's servant had opinions that led him to correct judgments, Meno seemed to become more patient towards the way Socrates was exploring the definition of _virtue_. Moreover, Socrates proved that being "perplexed and numb as a torpedo fish" can benefit people by allowing them to make right conclusions based on opinion rather than a sometimes misleading sources of knowledge (Meno, 84b). Meno however, pointed out that opinion, at times can be more misleading than knowledge (Meno, 97c).

Socrates later concluded that opinion and virtue is present in humans naturally from the day they are born. Knowledge and opinion according to the conclusions that Socrates and Meno have come up with, can both be used to make _pious_ decisions. As the example that Socrates gave with a man who knows how to get to Larissa because he once got there and another man who knows how to get to Larissa but never got there (Meno, 97a). In both cases, a person wanting to get to Larissa would get the right directions from both men. But in many other cases, Socrates adds that as the original source of knowledge gets passed down, it immediately becomes an opinion but opinions don't "remain long" so they start to "escape" one by one until they become a _recollection_ (Meno, 98a). As it seems, "knowledge" and "recollection" become almost like two contrary terms and "right opinion" becomes a periphery in between them.
