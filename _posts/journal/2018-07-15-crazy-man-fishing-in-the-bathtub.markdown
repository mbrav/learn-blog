A particular passage from Camus’s *The Myth of Sisyphus* had been bogging and fascinating my mind lately. It appears to have originated from Kafka and proceeds as follows: 

> You know the story of the crazy man who was fishing in a bathtub. A doctor with ideas as to psychiatric treatments asked him “if they were biting,” to which he received the harsh reply: “Of course not, you fool, since this is a bathtub.”[^1]

On one hand, this anecdote brilliantly expounds Camus’s notion of the “absurd”, as he himself puts it, “in it can be grasped quite clearly to what degree the absurd effect is linked to an *excess of logic*”.[^2] It brilliantly illustrates the futility of logic and reason to confront and explain absurdity—that which for Camus, is what manifests our life and permeates our goals and experiences that are ultimately meaningless.

Perhaps in the more literal sense, what this short anecdote demonstrates is the limits inherent of psychiatric knowledge—or any framework of positive knowledge for that matter—and the methods employed by the doctor-psychiatrist for understanding and diagnosing a patient. While sitting next to the patient, the psychiatrist observes the behavior of the patient and quite assuredly already sees the possible diagnoses; he sees the way through which he can penetrate and understand the subjectivity of his patient. Just like a physicist, the psychiatrist already has a decent bag of knowledge and methodologies that serve as a foundation on which he can lay out a hypothesis and a diagnose that would classify the mental abnormalities of his patient. Here one might also extract the Foucauldian conception of knowledge as power: The patient for the psychiatrist is an object of knowledge, just like an experiment is to a physicist; they both work within the empiricist presuppositions about their subject-matter, whose frameworks of knowledge fundamentally disregard whether the object of inquiry is alive or not. 

With this setup, the psychiatrist proceeds with his inquiry and poses a question that largely presupposes a judgment about the grave mental condition of the patient, he asks the patient “if they (the fishes) were biting”. The response that the psychiatrist receives is one that dissolves all the pretexts and assumptions that he had about the patient to their core, if not tackling the psychiatrist’s presuppositions through these very presuppositions themselves, in other words, turning the psychiatrist’s power knowledge methods against the authority that employs them  by a simple comical phrase: “Of course not, you fool, since this is a bathtub.” 

What therefore occurs in this turn is twofold; first, is that the psychiatrist’s intricate method of inquiry about patient’s subjectivity is proven futile when encountered by the logic of the absurd, namely, it did not occur to psychiatrist’s mind that perhaps the absurd reason behind the patient’s abnormal activity consisting of fishing in the bathtub, is not a product of the patient’s mental abnormalities, but a cause of absurd logic that the psychiatrist’s methods of knowledge are simply incapable of grasping; second, the patients response to the psychiatrist’s questions explicates an affirmative revolt that is manifested through the logic of the absurd, which brings any external attempt to instrumentalist knowledge, reason and logic—to its knees.    

The “excess of logic” is an ungraspable residue that remains when a person commits an absurd act; not only does it escape the methods of judging and establishing knowledge about an act, it affirms meaning in the meaningless that proliferates our world. This therefore demonstrates something more profound about about the methods of positive knowledge that human employ in sciences: not only do they fail to grasp the meaning behind, say, the man fishing in a bathtub, but they also frequently fail to understand an categorize phenomena in the natural world. Reality itself is inherently meaningless, and while we can employ certain frameworks of knowledge that give us helpful insights and predictions about the world, they are ultimately futile when it comes to establishing truth and meaning. Indeed, this is the problem of science; it provides great insights and effective methods for manipulating and gaining knowledge about the material world, but it desperately fails to be a source for meaning, consolation, values, and morals. The film *Melancholia* (2011) demonstrates these issues, which I analyze in [one of my previous posts](http://mbrav.com/journal/2018/06/05-god-and-consolation-in-melancholia).
