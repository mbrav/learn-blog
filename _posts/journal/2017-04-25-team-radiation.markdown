First medical X-ray by Wilhelm Röntgen of his wife Anna Bertha Ludwig's hand

On December 22, 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen made a first application of his new discovery on his wife Bertha Röntgen; he created the first X-ray exposure of a human hand. This is the moment when the transparency of a living human body was translated onto a screen — a thin layer of barium platinum cyanide.[^colomina] It was the creation of a medium, that turned human flesh and tissue into a transparent substance, that X-rays can easily penetrate. Under X-ray exposure, raw matter and the human body are equally transparent and uniform. There is something about X-rays that make them bizarre, even Bertha herself recounted that upon looking at the screen image of her hand, she famously said "I have seen my death" — a familiar reaction when one takes a glimpse at an X-ray of their own body.[^death] Radiation became a medium through which matter and the human body are no longer distinguishable in binary terms, but become mere gradients in a continuum of space.

More that 122 years later, Team Radiation is exploring the possibilities of using radiation, which upon Röntgen's introduction, gave the ability to glimpse at the gradients between matter and the the realm of living. In the modern context, Team Radiation seeks to explore and unravel the binary regard towards humans and machines.

## Initial Ideas and Explorations

Our Initial focus was to explore the electromagnetic spectrum and the ways in which we can explore the gradients between living and non-living matter. Although initially we where not yet aware about our ultimate goal, we where beginning to research and test methods that would eventually land us on our concept. These where one of the initial experiments and exploration that we have gone through. 

### Diffraction Grating: Dissecting the Electromagnetic Spectrum

One of the members of our Radiation team brought in a very interesting *artifact* that caught the attention of our whole group. It was a diffraction sheet which looked like any other plastic sheet, except that it had very peculiar light reflecting properties. This is because the sheet features hundreds of microscopic indented lines per millimeter. This in turn, causes the sheet to have a very particular light reflection abilities which can be used for "dissecting" the visual spectrum.

According to Wikipedia, Diffraction grating "is an optical component with a periodic structure, which splits and diffracts light into several beams traveling in different directions".[^a459300a] This technique is often used on CCD sensors which can be found on mobile phones and cameras. Diffraction grating is used to filter out Infrared and Ultraviolet radiation and leaves out the electromagnetic spectrum that can be sensed by the human eye (wavelengths from 390 to 700 nm[^85f02486]). We have also realized that the human eye can only sense a trillionth fraction of the whole electromagnetic spectrum — which is quite petty.  

### Cybernetic Sense as a Memory Augmentation

With our group we also talked about the very interesting aspect about how cybernetic senses are capable of forming completely new forms of spatial memories.

A Skype conference that we had with Liviu Babitz during Week 2, pinpointed how his North Sense allowed him to gain a more sensuous grasp about the various geographical locations that he visited. His sense allowed him to form memories about particular places that where not just based on his natural senses, but also on the "memory imprints" that his cybernetic sense made in addition to the memories that are collected by his natural senses. When his sense gets removed, as he recalled, it is as if he no longer has the ability to fix memories. His cybernetic sense has become a prosthetic for the creation of certain memories. 

This quality made a particularly  

### Cybernetic Sense as an Augmentation of the Brain's Deepest Functions.  

Thus, even if a cybernetic sense might not be seen as a sensuous augmentation, more attention can be dedicated to studying how cybernetic senses form memories in human brains subjects. Perhaps sense augmentation can be seen as something intriguing, but it also might be a superficial way of looking at the potential of cybernetic sense augmentation. New explorations and studies have yet to be made that study how cybernetic senses interact with the deepest functions of the brain. One of these concerned functions are memory and emotion. Our group concluded that that is where the potential of a cybernetic sensing lie.

For Week 4 of our Cyborg Futures class, we decided to make a prototype of a cybernetic sense. In the previous classes, our team has brainstormed the attributes that make up a sense. And of these, the most important attributes is the *input* and the *output* of a sense, which we formulate on a graph:

External phenomena  |  Input | Output
--|---|--
1. Reaction / Stimuli   |  2. Sensation |  3. Perception
An external physical occurrence which in some forms gets translated through the space/time dimension; it can be chemical, physical, atomic, or a electromagnetic occurrence.  |  The external physical occurrence (1) is somehow intercepted and perceived by a sense. |  The sensation (2) of an external phenomena gets translated into information that can be cognitively perceived.

The *input* is what can be considered the "reaction" caused from an external *stimuli*. Such a reaction can either be chemical, physical, electromagnetic, and temperature. When a reaction happens (1), it is somehow sensed (2) and then gets translated into a sensational *output* that can be understood by a cognitive system like the human brain (3). This is where the sense interfaces with the brain through a way of communication that the brain knows how to interpret.

### Vibration Motor Sensation

As mentioned in my [last week's blog](http://mbrav.com/journal/2017/02/14) I was particularly inspired by David Eagleman's TED talk called "[Can We Create new Senses for Humans?](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_eagleman_can_we_create_new_senses_for_humans) for reasons that I explain in that blog. But I decided to go forward and build a sense from the parts I ordered.

I built a device consisting of an Arduino Uno microcontroller, 6-8 flat vibration motors, and a tilt sensor. A tilt sensor was used purely for demonstration purposes but the intention is to replace this sensor with something that relates more to the notion of radiation and the electromagnetic spectrum.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mixania/32657376260/in/album-72157668323153014/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/283/32657376260_1d3f13fe52.jpg" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The *input* and *output* is demonstrated with this particular example. The input sense here is the tilt sensor, what it does is translates external *stimuli* into signals outputted by the vibration motors that can then be interpreted by the brain. From David Eagleman's TED talk, these vibration can be paced one a person's skin, and after some time, it will become capable of sensing whatever the input is capable of reacting too. In this case, it is a tilt sensor but can theoretically be any type of sensor. The *input* (the tilt sensor) is completely interchangeable.

### Vibro-Neuro prototype

For Week 5 of my Cyborg Futures class, I continued working on the cybernetic vibration motor sense prototype. I went ahead and started to assemble the parts together in order to produce some sort of a device. Considering that our team is still considering many options as to what our final sense will be, we all agreed to start making prototypes in order to increase the pace of this process.

My second prototype I decided to call *Vibro-Neuro* because is made out of vibration motors which resemble neural synapses. This provides a metaphor for the device which envisions an ability to function in symbiosis with the brain. And indeed, haptic feedback has immense potential for creating an augmented sensation that can symbiotically interface with a human's brain. In fact, vibration motors have allowed a deaf person [to regain his ability](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_eagleman_can_we_create_new_senses_for_humans) to hear without using the ear in any way.

A diagram of a neural synapse which the *Vibro-Neuro* prototype resembles.

While making this prototype, I continued to have in mind the *input* and *output* aspect that I discussed in [Week's 4 blog ](http://mbrav.com/journal/2017/02/21), that is, that the inputs and outputs can be interchangeable because they are made out of technology that itself is interchangeable.

![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2946/32361892013_6af9bda702_b.jpg)

So the project consists of essentially the same parts, except that the Arduino controller is a smaller version and I decided to use copious amounts of hot glue in order to fixate everything and to not allow things to disassemble whenever I want to showcase a prototype.  

![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3916/32361892213_94499c1e56_b.jpg)

The endings of the sense have 4 vibration motors because the wire itself contains 8 wires in total since each of the vibration motors requires two; negative and positive. These are meant to be the synapses of the sense organ in which manifests the potential for symbiosis with human brain. The cable itself is a savages Ethernet cable which gives the device a speculative aesthetic, especially when considering that i resembles a neural synapse in a technologic medium.

![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2877/33177198735_400cd39720_b.jpg)

The controller is essentially the same. For now the device does not have a sense, but it is something that will be incorporated in the next prototype.

![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3918/33049564891_823a7e147f_b.jpg)

And finally, this is a picture of the device being programmed by the computer. A metaphor for the human ambition to create a cybernetic human nature by means of a symbiotic unification with technology.
