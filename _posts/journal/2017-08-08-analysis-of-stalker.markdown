After watching *Stalker* (1979), directed by the notorious Soviet director Andrei Tarkovskii, I was moved — as one can be by any of his films — by its depth and meaning. The film can be interpreted in various ways, but for me, the film resonated a couple of important Nietzschean and Hegelian ideas.

Overall, the it can be seen how the Nietzschean dictum "God is dead", is very much prevalent in the background of Tarkovsky's work, and *Stalker* is no exclusion. A couple other points in the film are based on a Hegelian master-slave dialectic, and a couple profound points regarding aesthetic experience, particularly about Music, which very much echo Hegel's view on the subject. Music is brought up very subtly in the film, but nevertheless plays an important role since the main composer, Edward Artemiev applies music in profoundly theoretical manner with the musical tool of his time — the synthesizer.

The general plot of *Stalker*, is about a man who everyone calls "Stalker". He lives with his wife an daughter right near the Chernobyl reactor and makes a living by providing illegal guides to a heavily guarded place called the "the Zone". This zone, where presumably a meteorite fell, but in reality makes wishes come true, or if better worded to the films intent — makes *wills* come true.

## Character Analysis

This time, Stalker had two people to guide; a writer and a professor. The writer and the scientists form a sort of a Hegelian tension that then finds a resolution inside "the Zone" since both attempt to argue for their idea about how humankind ought to embrace the Nietzschean "will to power". Stalker on the other hand, is a subject who embraces the message of the film, who is an individual dissolved in "the Zone" itself. He embraces softness and fear, as opposed to stiffness and courage that is a result of the determination to the "will to power".

### The Writer
### The Professor
### Stalker

The movie ends with Stalker being frustrated and traumatized with the two men that paid him for his guide since they are longer able to hold any form of belief and religion towards anything, particularly towards the "the Zone". Stalker is therefore the subject that feels the trauma of the Nietzschean "God is dead" embraced in the beliefs of the two men, and perhaps, even in the beliefs of humankind as a whole.

When the three men arrive to "the Zone", the film suddenly changes from sepia to color; signifying a form of resolution to the viewer that contrasts "the Zone" with a monotonous life outside the zone where God is dead. Stalker, asks the two men to leave him on his own while Stalker goes on to reconcile with zone.
