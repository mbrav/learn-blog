In _Meno_, Plato tries to explain what virtue is by having Socrates pose questions to Meno, Anytus and Meno's servant. Socrates puts Meno and himself in a position of knowing nothing and starts to discuss whether virtue can be thought or is it something given to everyone at their birth.

At a certain point in the dialogue, Meno accuses Socrates of hypnotising him and forcing him not to be capable of answering questions that he would have easily answered otherwise. Socrates is simply posing questions to Meno the same way he later proved to be doing with his servant. It turned out that the servant was proven to have opinions that eventually lead to knowledgeable judgments about simple geometric rules. The servant had never learned geometry, yet he was capable of observing and making correct conclusions to which Socrates, Meno and the laws of geometry agreed upon.

The servant didn’t know anything about geometry but managed to come up with right answers based on his judgment instead of knowledge. Socrates draws the same parallel of how _virtue_ can be defined. It doesn’t have to come from a solid source of knowledge but instead, it comes from judgment and reasoning.

Whether the definition of virtue was defined in the dialogue remains dubious. Even by the end of the dialogue, more questions where created rather than answered. Nevertheless, this is perhaps a Socratic principle that is used to reason and question various phenomena using philosophy as a _fulcrum_ and questions as a lever. The more questions there are, the longer the lever - stronger the leverage.
