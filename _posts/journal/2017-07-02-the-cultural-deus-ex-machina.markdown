As Nietzsche's famous dictum in his *The Birth of Tragedy* (1872) goes, "it is only as an *aesthetic phenomenon* that existence and the world are eternally justified".[^3] If art dies, then so does the way we look at our world and existence: nothing is no longer eternally justified, and becomes secularized—*dead*. And here we are, living in a dead world where everything called "aesthetically pleasing"—is a rotting dead corpse: an arrangement of matter spreading through the deceasing corpse of our global culture.

To demonstrate the determinations of modern consumer global culture, and the way we are easily persuaded to mask our reality with an Apollonian idea. Nietzsche makes a great analogy, of how when we forcefully attempt to gaze at the sun, we see dark spots in front of us as we turn away blinded.[^1] These dark spots in front of our vision, are, as it where, "cures". By analogy, when we look at an image of, say a Sephora commercial depicting a overly photoshopped lady, or a perhaps even a transexual, holding a new lipstick product; we contrast this image with the figure that we see in front of our mirror, and think how gruesome we would continue looking if we *won't* buy the product depicted in the illusory commercial (and even re-consider our sexuality on the side).

This is the Apollonian image of our culture, that is not just a figure of Cara Delavigne, but thousands of other models lined up during Fashion Week shows—like the ones you may find in a brothel. These models just blindly claim they support various equalities, express support for capitalist-Ivanka-Trump-Hillary-Clinton form of feminism, different body types, anti-discriminations, etc. etc.—all while contradicting themselves. The contradiction comes when millions of people will be living according to the illusory Apollonian images these model help to fabricate; which compel the petty-consumers who seek to reach their illusion of freedom, only sometimes to realize how much they where enslaved by their illusory idea—as we are compelled to learn from *Requiem for a Dream* (2000).

To triumph what the moral order imposed by the Apollonian images, our culture has returned to a state where it degenerately expresses a primordial form of individuality, through a narcissistic, subservient manifestation of a vision.[^2] Our liberal values, have become an instrument to our capitalist machine; so much, that our primordial expression of individuality is what fuels the growing stock prices of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Sephora, Zara etc.

But this subservient funneling of our inner predispositions, perhaps, can be explained by the fact that we no longer feel comfortable with a moral order imposed by a Nazi *deus ex machina*, dictating how the living matter of the human body must be arranged, what aesthetic judgement it must have, how the human must evolve to not 'degenerate', and what non-'degenerate'[^n1] humans must create. Our capitalist-neoliberal world is frightened by the idea of such an order, while it fails to recognize that it has become submissive to something more-or-less equivalent—the global capitalist *deus ex machina*, where individuality is a naive fantasia; where culture is just a mass of programmable automata—waiting to be programmed by Facebook and Netflix.

This *deus ex machina* that I'm referring to, is very much like the kind that Karl Marx already described in _The German Ideology_ (1845):

> Those who are oppressed nowadays in society, think only about how to achieve the society which is _right for them_, and is this consists primarily in abolishing the present society on the basis of the existing productive forces...Those who need the machine (for example, in order to make money) find the fault in the machine and try to alter it, etc.—...they are setting themselves the task not of putting the machine _right_, but of discovering the _right_ machine, the holy machine, the machine as the incarnation of the holy, the holy as the machine, the machine in the heavens.[^42da09c1]

This machine, is can be interpreted as "a convention of Greek tragedy where a seemingly unsolvable problem is resolved by an unexpected intervention of some new event, ability or object. An invention like money, is an example of an invention that not only allowed humans to overcome decaying processes of nature, but also altered the human condition where natural processes no longer interfere with the human processes of accumulating and securing labor power."[^8d34d229]

Our society welcomes the expression of individuality; where soon instead of sex an gender, we will have a hermaphrodite—a biologic body that is able to self-reproduce, and embrace any form of individuality based on the program instructions of global capitalist *deus ex machina* programs it—the epitome of a Quere!—right? The individuality will be happy regardless; naively claiming it expressed its individuality and gender through its own agency when in fact, its agency was determined and converted into a quantifiable quanta—this is the simplification and reduction of individuality that humans are subjecting themselves to.

[^n1]: (German: *Entartete Kunst*)—A term adopted by the Nazi regime in Germany to describe Modern art. (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art)) It is important to note the Nietzsche had alluded to *degenerate art*—among numerous other ideas—half-a-century earlier than the Nazi's eluded to their terms. Nietzsche is sometimes dismissed as a provoker of Nazi thought, but those who claim so, unlikely have the mental capacities to comprehend his thought in an Absolute form; contrary to a dissected, labeled, fragmented reading of one the greatest philosophic minds. Thought this also has to do with improper translation of Nietzsche into the English language.
