By reading the text it is noticeable that the author emphasises that only secondary sources of Heraclitus’ ideas survive until this day. Even the most popular philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle refused to reflect or reflected little on his philosophy since it was considered to be vague (p. 185). Nevertheless, Heraclitus does contemplate on _archē_ of things, the soul and even at a certain extent, the reason behind the world’s existence.  

Heraclitus considered that the principle of everything in our Universe or also known as _Logos,_ was water and fire. By that, I don't think he meant it literally even though physically speaking, hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe and ironically, it is contained in water. What he meant instead, was that water’s essence is the principle from which our whole world is made but not from the water itself. Fire, similar to water, is the principal of everything as well however, it also keeps a balance of the “cosmic fire”. These two principles are in constant balance and play two different roles on the soul. According to Heraclitus, water diminishes the soul in capacity and upon the death of the body, the soul becomes part of the “cosmic fire” (p. 207, 204).

Whether water is the principle of everything or not, Heraclitus made many interesting observations based on it essence. Anything can produce two opposite effects, go opposite directions and be beneficial in one way and detrimental in another (Heraclitus, 199-202). If this statement is true, then multiple instances of _archē_ can coexist so therefore, an opposite of our world can exist and a reverse of our world can exist. Opposite being to our own judgement however, there is never a clear division of an opposite from another opposite (p. 190). Nevertheless, the whole world is dependant on the constant balance between opposites and once one opposite outweighs the other, the whole world collapses (p.193).  

Human actions, decisions and conflicts according to Heraclitus, resembles the nature of our Universe (Heraclitus, 211). Just like random phenomena such a cosmic noise, earthquakes and encounters with asteroids, human actions such as wars or prosperous events, need to happen one way or another simply because the possibility of these actions does exist.

Heraclitus also made an interesting observation about humans that they fail to understand reality by fabricating “private and deceptive intelligence” making it hard for our intelligence to even grasp some philosophic concepts (p. 187).
