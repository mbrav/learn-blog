After downloading flac files of Burial’s *Untrue* (2007) album onto my phone in the begining of August, I commenced a Burial therapy that has lasted for 4 days, a couple hours of which were what I would call ‘Burial CPR’. I listened to the track “Untrue” from Burial’s album *Untrue* (2007) more than 10 times almost consecutively, and the album itself more than 5 times consecutively. It is the first time in my life that something like this had occurred to me. I think I first became familiar with Burial through a collaboration with another favorite artist of mine: Four Tet, whose album *There is Love in You* (2010) is one of my favorites. Then I [appreciated](https://youtu.be/Et5B-zfAIIo) the technicalities of Burial’s album, then I stumbled upon a couple Mark Fisher’s k-pung blog posts about Burial which amazingly contextualized ([here](http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/009782.html), [here](http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/007666.html)) my intuitions and feelings about Burial’s music. But that was before the album became much more than it had for me during these past couple days. I decided to give the album a run during a couple emotionally hefty days that I had to drag myself through, the causes and motivations would be left in abstract. But overall, *Untrue* became more than an album, it is a medication for reconciling dreadful and difficult emotional states.

The track “Untrue” is undoubtedly one of the deepest and profound cruxes of Burial’s ambient time-stretched dreading ambient urban-cave sound therapy—if a description of the album *Untrue* can be given in just a few words. When one listens to it and feels the absorption of the sound in their entrenched soul; one goes beyond just the want to cry. In this sense, Burial’s *Untrue* album is a sublimation of the function of a sad song: just to mourn over one’s feelings while having a sound to cry to. Instead, the sound becomes more like a therapist (yes, not just a therapy).
	
When one familiarizes a sound which penetrates and resonates with one’s own body and soul, they might encounter an emotional deadlock: one might end up paralyzed both physically and emotionally as Burial’s time-stretched kicks and snares bombard one’s deprived emotional state, but instead of causing further harm, the bombardment becomes absorbed by the listener’s state. The absorption goes the other way around, the listener—the beholder of the sound—integrates into the track itself. In this state, one is in dialogue with the sound. When one is in a state of giving some preliminary thoughts about how their note left behind might look like, the track, almost like a friend, compels the dreading lister to suspend these thoughts for the time being; if nothing else does, the track becomes the sole reconciliation with ones own emotions and failures. In this moment, all you want is to let the resonance of the kicks, bass, and snare fill the emotional void inside you.

Perhaps the most important aspect of the album are the time-stretched kicks and drums in every track, where every one of them diverges in character, each one of them seeking to comunicate something different when accompanied with the unique ambience of every track. Tracks “Untrue”, “Archangel”, “Near Dark”, “Ghost Hardware” (in order of preference) all demonstrate this aspect. When contemplating about what makes the kicks of these drums so emotionally curing I have thought of the following: sometimes when one experiences a down, a couple more emotional soft kicks and punches from within is what one needs in order to cary one’s existence along. *I think of it as an emotional CPR*. One might conclude: If this track can live on, then so can I along with it. Along with that, something can be brought out of Camus’s wager: “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Here indeed, Burial’s *Untrue* album is precisely the cup of coffee that one needs to drag oneself through (maybe at least) another day, except that the album is much more than a coffee that one simply consumes. It is in this sense that some Burial’s tracks can act as a CPR in a life-death moment, where instead of saving a life with two hands, one can save it using two earbuds.

Going back to the track “Untrue” however, I want to point out how the ambient sound that is first heard on 0:34 and repeats throughout the track, acts as something that induces sublimating body shiver, as if it is an electricity that causes every cell of the body to express and emotional resonance. I think this ambient sound is the epitome of a shiver-inducing sound, I get them every time the sound runs trough my ears, sometimes disregarding whether I am in a cold air-conditioned interior space, or desperately melting beneath the hot August sun. It is precisely this aspect of Burial’s sound that can penetrates one’s deepest emotions, when it does, one becomes astounded and parallelized, almost as if one was struck by a sword blade. It is precisely here that the name *Untrue* expresses itself: when one is struck in a deep and profound way, one does not feel this state as *false* as if it were a negative of *truth*; rather, one feels that one had been struck and remains confused and paralyzed, it is a moment of *untruth* where one’s belief is in suspense.

It is ironical that the softest and tender tracks of teh album is “In McDonalds”

But “Homeless” is precisely what motivates one to drag onself throughout the day.
