At this day an age, as we are being caught up in the depletion of the precious durability and energy of our minds and bodies, in the tasks of our civilization's established order—that maintains its prevalence amidst the chaotic character of nature, in an unordered cosmos. We rarely look up to question what can we, humans, offer the Universe amidst 100-400 billion other solar systems in our Milky Way galaxy, which in turn, is a galaxy amidst another 2 trillion galaxies in the whole observable Universe. In other words (and numbers), what is so exciting about our present living conditions that are to impress someone-somewhere among ~500'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 other solar systems?

If you ever feel that your activities are futile and meaningless amidst the vastness of space—trust your intuition, for this time it was not mistaken! But don't remain preoccupied with your intuition for long—there is enough space in the Universe to fill a wine glass of any size. It is numbers and turtles all the way down. Drink.

So *where are we?* Well, it depends what you mean by *where*. See, the human language evolved on this a small rock suspended in space, where everything is defined relatively to experiences and conditions that humans have constructed throughout the span of history—while most of us, still struggle to distinguish *left* from *right*. But let that not be a sufficient dismissal of our capacities! We are able to define where we are relative to objects that surround us. We name these objects that we find according to an instrument of our semantic toolset—known as the human *language*. We use it to call things "Gay Street" or a stellar objects "MH782". In other words, we know *where* we are relative to ideas that we ourselves fabricated. We also know that humanism is a good ground for moral values, but that would be a separate topic, perhaps, when wine permits to unravel one of the most remarkable products of human creation—fabricated ideas.

So where are we? Well, we might be somewhere in the outskirts of space, or, one might perhaps one day discover that we are part of a massive, rapidly expanding cosmic flatulence. But that doesn't sound promising, does it? Well, it doesn't seem to trouble parasites that devour mammalian guts, cancer that spreads through living bodies, and humans—who like their mould cousins—blindly prosper while hanging on thin strings of temporal stability. Mold might survive a major cataclysm, but nothing survives the chaotic forces of the rapidly expanding cosmic flatulence; where a supernova nova explosion of a star within several dozen light-years from Earth—can bleach our planet.

It seems like there is never a good answer to *where* are we, *what* are we, and *what* are we doing. But I welcome you to not give up your existential journey, for it is the greatest journey you could take in the span of your futile life.
