I’ve had a couple thoughts during the past days which made me question: will humans as a species eventually come to a stage where all forms of exploitation are abolished? Is there a possibility where all humans become freed from all forms of exploitation such as wage-labor, data extractivism, etc. Or is this a burden that some of us will forever face?

One of the promises that we keep hearing today, is that technologic advancement will bring equality and make most forms of exploitation obsolete; assuming that all humans will be granted longevity, robots will manufacture our material necessities, and humanity will finally be freed from all toils that life brings, which where once a matter of survivability and necessity. Even if these promises become a reality, there is still a very hard question concerning the definition of *value* that remains unanswered.

To start, I want to define two important forms of value that are commonly regarded in moral philosophy:

* Intrinsic value
* Extrinsic value

Today, we have a system of value in place that accounts both, intrinsic and extrinsic value, but the former is by far more predominate. The reason why today’s notion of value is incompatible with the utopian future that many of us have in mind, is that today’s notion of *value* relies on the idea that everything can have a quantifiable value based on how much material and energy is expended during the creation and maintenance of a particular commodity. In other words, this is *extrinsic value* which ascribes a value to commodities based on how much natural resources and labor is expended during its production process.   

But the interesting aspect about *extrinsic value*, is that the humanist outlook tends to ascribe a contrary form of value on living creatures, especially humans. We think that the value of a human being is not just an aggregate of matter and energy expended to sustain 10 trillion living cells that constitute a human body—the humanistic value of a human life is something more than that. The terms that humans use to ascribe intrinsic value to something are descriptions that contain phrases like “in itself”, “for its own sake”, or “in its own right". And this is called *intrinsic value*.

But the biggest question that I have—and which I hope humanity will start collectively asking—is for how long can intrinsic and extrinsic value coexist without one overtaking the other? If the whole aspect of capitalism is to put a quantifiable price on everything, what makes one think that the same won't occur with things that have an intrinsic value, like for example, human life?

Since the advent of basic forms of trade and mercantilism, human economies have been ascribing a market value to nearly everything that can be exchanged, exploited, produced, etc. At this stage of human development, there is barely an acre of land that does not have an extrinsic value ascribed to it. And with the advent of new technology, things like personal data, behavioral data, mental activity, DNA—all begin to possess the potential to become exchangeable commodity forms in the market place.

Every new technological advance brings a new method through which human nature can be marketed and commodified. By doing so, humans become consumers that merge with the value system imposed by the market. The market starts to "know" exactly what the consumer needs to have in order to stay nourished and satisfied, and the consumer pays this with a monetary price, personal data, consumption, etc.—all which have a quantifiable *extrinsic value*. In this form of evaluation, *extrinsic value* becomes less and less *intrinsic*.
