After reading *Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software* by Steven Johnson, and *Adversarial Design* by Carl DiSalvo, I started to think about about a project that incorporates some of theme that are explored in the readings.

What I found interesting in the aspect of *emergence*, is how  complex behaviors emerge from relatively simple organization. In Johnson's terms, it is a "movement from low-level rules to higher-level sophistication is what we call emergence"[^j1]. In nature we can see how various systems like ant colonies form very complex systems that emerge from relatively simple behaviors. But with ants in particular, it is interesting to note how each of them individually is linked to a collective network of a swarm. The ant colony emerges into a sort of a conscious organism which becomes aware of it’s internal health and economy of sorts. This also allows ants to proactively respond to dangers that threaten the whole colony by interfacing directly with the swarm’s network.

This led me to think about how humans can develop a collective network that is as effective as the one of ants. Although we do have form of network called the Internet, we are not as sophisticatedly integrated into it. Although we use powerful electronic devices to interface with the internet using high-bandwidth speeds, we use our low-bandwidth biological limbs to interact with these devices. I started to think about how we can integrate our behavior so that we can proactively respond to treats just like ants. This is where Carl DiSalvo’s *Adversarial Design* came in. What is particularly interesting about this particular notion of design, is that it probes social and political issues and relations with the help so called “ubicomp” devices[^d1]. These are devices that are integrated into human behavior so that the issues becomes more perceptible and more related to the subject.

## Idea

In Johnson’s *Emergence* I was intrigued by his own experience with his doctor who was examining his adrenaline system[^j2]. At the end of the session, the doctor complemented him for having a healthy adrenaline system except for the six or seven dramatic spikes that where seen on the graph. Each of the spikes corresponded to the jokes that Johnson made during session. But Johnson’s objective conclusion for these adrenalin spikes is quite startling. He concluded that he was “addicted” to jokes because since they cause a dose of adrenaline to be released into his bloodstream. Johnson’s brain enjoys this small adrenaline rush and is what cause Johnson to become “addicted” to jokes.

Adrenaline together with serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, among a dozen other types of hormones, function as a reward system for our brain. Based on the actions we make, we are rewarded with certain levels of these substance. All our actions are based on these *feedback mechanisms* which form our complex personalities.

This led me to think about if it would be possible to take advantage of these *feedback mechanisms* and train ourselves to do environmentally friendly practices. These include picking up trash, compartmentalizing waste, or decreasing our consumerist habits. To do so, it is necessary to create a device that rewards us with a *positive feedback* and *negative feedback* substances. This ways, we could become addicted to actions that benefit our environment. Just like Johnson is addicted to jokes, we can train ourselves to become addicted to certain actions.

Devices that release substances into the bloodstream already exist in form of insulin implants that are actively used by diabetics. They do not alter the behavior of the patient, but they serve an important role for their health.

I began of thinking ways how I could feasibly experiment with a device that can somehow release certain substance into my bloodstream which my brain will then react to. I have looked at a few brave experimenters who [inserted a biochip implant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIiP1H3Opw) under their skin. While I take it as an inspiration, I don’t think the benefits would outnumber the health hazards that such an experiment might pose.

But instead of injecting substances into my bloodstream, I can think of some other ways that I can do that using safer methods.  I thought about substances that people are addicted to, such as nicotine, sugars, and alcohol. What if I train myself to do certain actions by becoming addicted to one of these substances? I can then build a device that will safely release these substance depending on my behavior. Electronic cigarets seemed to be an intriguing option. What if a build a device that releases nicotine smoke based on how environmentally friendly my behavior is?

I sketched out my initial plans of such a device:
