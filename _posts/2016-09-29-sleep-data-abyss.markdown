I first starting out with a project that was initially intended to be called “Sleep Harmonics”, I had a preconception about my relation to personal data, and ways of how I would like to visualize it. My immediate desire was to visualize this data within a meaningful context. My optimism assumed that the processes of sleep, could produce harmonious relations between the visuals and sounds that get generated by the data.

It took me a couple weeks to accept the fact that my data alone, could not produce anything that embodies order and harmony. Immense manipulation of the data is necessary before some visual aesthetic can be produced. But when immense amounts of manipulation is necessary to produce something that can be visually conceived, the aesthetic and pure quality is striped away from personal data. In other words, huge amounts of sugar coating is necessary before something that is visually pleasant is produced out of something disorderly and chaotic like data. Regardless, I managed to visualize my data, and I felt like my data was represented well, and some quantitative details where drawn, but the qualitative and aesthetic fell was not recognized from my personal point of view. It was an informational representation of data, but it does not give a subjective connotation when I will decide to look at it back in time.

Ultimately, what is my relation to this data, and how could it be useful on a personal level, rather than just being a constituent of millions of other data points that individuals willingly submit to various entities that manipulate the data. The trust our data in the hands of entities that know how to represent and visualize our personal data. Millions of people give their data to people who know how to extract meaning out of data. This made me reflect on the quality of raw personal data and I concluded that is *abyssal*.  

> In a hypothetical world where everything is either meaningful or meaningless, personal data would be the only thing that lies in-between.

*Abyss* is a profoundly allegorical word. It has multiple meanings including words like Hell, a bottomless pit, a voided space, or an imminent catastrophic happening. This is the term that I eventually realized embodies my personal data, as apposed to something orderly and harmonic. It is a allegoric word that does not give beauty to data, but does not necessarily dismiss it as meaningless. In a hypothetical world where everything is either meaningful or meaningless, personal data would be the only thing that lies in-between. I want to convey the abyssal quality of data not through the expected ways of ordered data representation, but through an immersive experience that would convey the chaotic and abstracted nature of personal data.

The Abyssal feeling can also be ascribed to the subjective feeling when one’s personal data is collected. *Sleep Data Abyss* seeks to formulate and convey a feeling that can arise when one is willingly collecting his personal data. In the present moment, one can never predict how his data might look in the future, or how his experience will be looked at objectively as a past occurrence. It is a feeling that welcomes an awareness of the past, present, and the future.
> The parsing machine par excellence is the algorithm, and it dominates much of our digital lives. In recent years, algorithms have been telling us what music to listen to, who we should date, what stocks we should buy, and even what we should eat. It comes as no surprise, then, that it should also tell us what art we should view. But what happens when the art we are looking at becomes the algorithm itself? [^O’Brien]

## Transforming Chaos into Data

An interesting example was demonstrated by Google’s research labs at Google. This demonstrates that even disorder and chaos can be transformed into something that can be visually discerned. It is creating something meaningful out of data through immense amounts of data manipulation through neural networks and machine learning algorithms. But no matter how complex this system of data manipulation is, it is can be simplified into something as far as an act of transforming chaos into order.

Snowden’s revelations of imagery are is an interesting relation to data. It is labeled as a “secret”, yet one one cannot see anything on it. Although the image was later decrypted by GCHQ technicians to reveal a picture of clouds in the sky. This however conveys how our perception of data is entirely mediated by digital technologies and the agents who manipulate these technologies. “Snowden’s image of noise could stand in for a more general human inability to perceive technical signals unless they are processed and translated accordingly.”[^Steyerl] The data of this particular example of course, comes from a video stream from a military drone’s camera. But when personal data is the subject, there might not be a significant difference. Any subject who’s data is collected becomes materialized, it does not matter whether it is alive or not. Regardless what the subject is, it is treated the same, a subjects who’s behavior becomes more quantifiable and predictable. This does not necessarily give a dystopian context to personal data, it is a matter of who posses this data. It can go as far as an ideological view that demonizes personal data no matter under who’s authority it is. But ideological or not, the question is if there is any agency remaining in us the sources of this data.

Another example that questions the agency of individual who are sources of data, is IBM’s Watson AI system which was experimentally programmed to potentially identify terrorists posing as refugees.[^RefugeeOrTerrorist] Although it is an effective utilitarian approach for the interests of national security, it should be questioned what is stripped from the human condition. If our data allows someone to identify and quantify who we are, what is there left for us?

Another unnerving example of how personal data can serve as a quantifying tool of it subjects, is what Ben Waber, a chief executive officer at Humanyze, demonstrated under Bloomberg’s article titled *Wall Street Embraces Emotional Trading Surveillance*[^Humanyze].

## Examples of Personal Data Transformations

The ideas that are presented, are widely based on conceptual art [^Conceptual]. The materialization aspect behind data was the main concern. But various artist have pinpointed ways of how personal data can be humanized and transformed into something aesthetic.

By Keeping the subject vague allows viewers to bring their own meaning to her personal display of data. She is using her body as an instrument to visualize her subjective experience of here body, something that medical imagining an x-ray imaginary does not necessarily achieve. For her, a doctor and medicine is based on past medical research. These are authorities that know how to read our body better than us. Our body is aquatinted as closed system even thought we spend our lives with it. Lewis seeks to give the authority back to the user. Doctors sometimes help to deal with the bodies’s patient in ways that are dismissive to the person’s experience.[^Lewis]

> I work with systems primarily and the idea of using a systematic way of dealing with the material … It’s very unscientific but that’s also the point of putting it into such a geometric form. [^Lewis]

Many data artists are responding to an increasingly data-saturated culture. ~~I notices a general theme that surfaced in my peer’s projects.~~

Another reflection on data as a sinful reflection of self is made by Laurie Frick. She proclaims to be an artist who makes art based on the future of personal data. “We’ve got from completely mysterious, to completely known.” Thew question is by whom, is someone else but ourself? But Frick found a personal connection with the data she was visualizing. It felt “organic and personal”. When its abstracted and played back in places that we live, it “might be shortcut to mindfulness” or “a technology to post our immune system”. “Maybe our brain cannot tell the difference between meditative self reflection and an intake of a data selfie”. [^Frick2].

> It’s about what these patterns will tell us about ourselves. Perhaps seeing the abstract patterns and rhythms of your own data is a short-cut to mindfulness. A quick and dirty way to boost your immune system, the benefits of meditation and self-reflection without much effort [^Frick]

What if we can become aware of our bodies systems, the same way we can become aware of the data that highlights inconsistencies. But will our agency over our data be guaranteed, or while there always be someone who uses the data to a bigger advantage but us?
