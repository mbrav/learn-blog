When first starting out with a project that was initially intended to be called “Sleep Harmonics”, I had a preconception about my relation to personal data, and ways of how I would like to visualize it. My immediate desire was to visualize this data within a meaningful context. My optimism assumed that the processes of sleep, could produce harmonious relations between the visuals and sounds that get generated by the data.

It took me a couple weeks to accept the fact that my data alone, could not produce anything that embodies order and harmony. Immense manipulation of the data is necessary for some visual aesthetic to be produced. But this strips away the pureness from the data, and sugar coats it. I felt like my data was represented well, and some quantitative details where drawn, but the qualitative aesthetic was not seen from a personal point of view. It was informational representation of data, but it did not produce anything that would allow me to reflect back in time.

Ultimately, what is my relation to this data, and how could it be useful on a personal level, rather than just being a constituent of millions of other data points that individuals willingly submit to various entities that manipulate the data. The trust our data in the hands of entities that know how to represent and visualize our personal data. 

An interesting example was demonstrated by Google’s research labs at Google. This demonstrates that even disorder and chaos can be transformed into something that can be visually discerned. It is creating something meaningful out of data through immense amounts of data manipulation.

*Abyss* is a profoundly allegorical word. It has multiple meanings including words like Hell, a bottomless pit, a voided space, or an imminent catastrophic happening. This is the term that I eventually realized embodies data, as apposed to something orderly and harmonic. It is a allegoric word that does not give beauty to data, but does not necessarily dismiss it as meaningless. I want to convey the abyssal quality of data not through the expected ways of ordered data representation, but through an immersive experience that would convey chaotic and abstracted nature of personal data.

~~I notices a general theme that surfaced in my peer’s projects.~~

Snowden’s revelations of imagery are is an interesting relation to data. It is labeled as a “secret”, yet one one cannot see anything on it. Although the image was later decrypted by GCHQ technicians to reveal a picture of clouds in the sky. This however conveys how our perception of data is entirely mediated by digital technologies and the agents who manipulate these technologies. “Snowden’s image of noise could stand in for a more general human inability to perceive technical signals unless they are processed and translated accordingly.”[^Steyerl] The questions is if there is any agency remaining in us the sources of this data.

Another example that questions the agency of individual who are sources of data, is IBM’s Watson AI system which was experimentally programmed to potentially identify terrorists posing as refugees.[^RefugeeOrTerrorist] Although it is an effective utilitarian approach for the interests of national security, it  should be questioned what is stripped from the human condition. If our data allows someone to identify and quantify who we are, what is there left for us?
