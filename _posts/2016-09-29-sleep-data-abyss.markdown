This is a study that describes the development process of a project intended to be called *Sleep Data Abyss*. It regards the visualization of my personal data through an app called [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/). The project was first intended to be referred to as “Sleep Harmonics” because of my preliminary assumption that poetical and harmonic outcomes can be created out of data. My immediate intention was to visualize this data within a meaningful context. My optimism assumed that the processes of sleep, could produce harmonious qualities of the sounds and visuals generated based on the data.

Having this misleading assumption in mind, it took me a couple weeks to accept the fact that my data alone, could not produce an embodiment of order and harmony. Although my data set only consisted of only 20-30 monitored nights, I already began noticing how misrelated I am with this data. Immense manipulation of it is necessary before some communicative visual can be generated. It is a process that intends to translate data into a human visual language — a highly abstracted semantic system. This language by it its function, cannot translate subjective experiences as well as it translates visual meaning.

But when immense amounts of manipulation is necessary to produce something that can be visually understood, the qualitative aspect gets striped away from the data. Humans have developed this weird abstracted semantic language for representing data; constituted by bar graphs, charts, lines, and points. Raw personal data, to a some degree, is a mark and an extension of a subject’s existence. But when this personal data gets visualized quantitatively — through points, charts, and lines — the subject becomes materialized. It no longer becomes important if the subject is living or not, the outcome is the same — a materialized representation of data where every data point can be quantified and optimized. I no longer see my data as an extension of my existence, but I do see how I can optimize my behavior.  

One however, may argue that visualized data can nevertheless reflect on the extension of a subject’s existence through data. Laurie Frick’s work is an example of how personal data can allow a subject to reflect back in time. But the way popular culture tends to visualize personal data, are mainly applied for informational ends. They are not applied towards meditative ends, nor the revival of a subject’s existence. It is commonly accepted that data visualization is pointless if it does not have an informational quality. Those who still believe that a subjective experience is nevertheless possible through an informative representation of personal data, would one really think that it can reach a level of subjective representation as that of a Picasso or Kandinsky painting?

With our current technologies, human subjective experience is scarcely conveyed through 1’s, 0’s. But one can adhere to the ideas of science fiction that envision a brain-computer interface that could potentially allow the translation of human subjective experience through digital information and data. But until the day when such a product of fiction becomes a reality, any stranger that looks at the representation of someone else’s personal data, would only be able to perceive its informational quality, but not its subjective part. Or perhaps, we can envision a modern equivalent of Picasso or Kandinsky, who would be able to express subjective experiences using data. Perhaps it would be a pioneer of *data expressionism*.

But ultimately, what is the relation between me and my personal data and how is it useful on a personal level, rather than it just being a constituent of millions of other data points. Many individuals willingly submit their personal data to various entities. The trust of our personal data is in the hands of entities that know how to extract meaning out of it. This made me reflect on the quality of my raw personal data when meaning is not extracted out of it. I concluded that best word that describes the quality of raw data is *abyssal*.  

> In a hypothetical world where everything is either meaningful or meaningless, personal data would be the only thing that lies in-between.

*Abyss* is a profoundly allegorical word. It has multiple meanings including words like Hell, a bottomless pit, a voided space, or an imminent catastrophic happening. This is the term that I eventually realized embodies my personal data, as apposed to something orderly and harmonic. It is a allegoric word that does not give beauty to data, but does not necessarily dismiss it as meaningless. In a hypothetical world where everything is either meaningful or meaningless, personal data would be the only thing that lies in-between. I wanted to convey the abyssal quality of data not through the expected ways of ordered data representation, but through an immersive experience that would convey the chaotic and abstracted nature of personal data.

The Abyssal feeling can also be ascribed to the subjective feeling when one’s personal data is collected. *Sleep Data Abyss* seeks to formulate and convey a feeling that can arise when one willingly collects his/her personal data. In the present moment, one can never predict how this data might look in the future, or how his experience will be looked at as a past occurrence. It is a feeling that welcomes an awareness of the past, present, and the future.

## Transforming Chaos into Data

An interesting example was demonstrated by Google’s research labs at Google. This demonstrates that even disorder and chaos can be transformed into something that can be visually discerned. It is creating something meaningful out of data through immense amounts of data manipulation through neural networks and machine learning algorithms. But no matter how complex this system of data manipulation is, it is can be simplified into something as far as an act of transforming chaos into order.

Snowden’s revelations of imagery are is an interesting relation to data. It is labeled as a “secret”, yet one one cannot see anything on it. Although the image was later decrypted by GCHQ technicians to reveal a picture of clouds in the sky. This however conveys how our perception of data is entirely mediated by digital technologies and the agents who manipulate these technologies. “Snowden’s image of noise could stand in for a more general human inability to perceive technical signals unless they are processed and translated accordingly.”[^Steyerl] The data of this particular example of course, comes from a video stream from a military drone’s camera. But when personal data is the subject, there might not be a significant difference. Any subject who’s data is collected becomes materialized, it does not matter whether it is alive or not. Regardless what the subject is, it is treated the same, a subjects who’s behavior becomes more quantifiable and predictable. This does not necessarily give it a dystopian connotation to personal data, it is a matter of who posses this data. It can go as far as an ideological view that demonizes personal data no matter under who’s authority it is. But ideological or not, the question is if there is any agency remaining in us the sources of this data.

Another example that questions the agency of individual who are sources of data, is IBM’s Watson AI system which was experimentally programmed to potentially identify terrorists posing as refugees.[^RefugeeOrTerrorist] Although it is an effective utilitarian approach for the interests of national security, it should be questioned what is stripped from the human condition. If our data allows someone to identify and quantify who we are, what is there left for us?

Another unnerving example of how personal data can serve as a quantifying tool of it subjects, is what Ben Waber, a chief executive officer at Humanyze, demonstrated under Bloomberg’s article titled *Wall Street Embraces Emotional Trading Surveillance*.[^Humanyze] It is an example where meaning is extracted from our personal data that otherwise would’ve likely remained omniscient to us. If we are the owners of data, we should be the ones that need to know how to use the tools to extract meaning out of data. But instead, we give this obscured amounts of personal data to entities that know exactly how to extract meaning out of it.

> The parsing machine par excellence is the algorithm, and it dominates much of our digital lives. In recent years, algorithms have been telling us what music to listen to, who we should date, what stocks we should buy, and even what we should eat. It comes as no surprise, then, that it should also tell us what art we should view. But what happens when the art we are looking at becomes the algorithm itself?[^Brien]

## Examples of Personal Data Transformations

The ideas that are presented, are widely based on conceptual art.[^Conceptual] The materialization aspect behind data was the main concern. But various artist have pinpointed ways of how personal data can be humanized and transformed into something aesthetic.

By Keeping the subject vague allows viewers to bring their own meaning to her personal display of data. She is using her body as an instrument to visualize her subjective experience of here body, something that medical imagining an x-ray imaginary does not necessarily achieve. For her, a doctor and medicine is based on past medical research. These are authorities that know how to read our body better than us. Our body is aquatinted as closed system even thought we spend our lives with it. Lewis seeks to give the authority back to the user. Doctors sometimes help to deal with the bodies’s patient in ways that are dismissive to the person’s experience.[^Lewis]

> I work with systems primarily and the idea of using a systematic way of dealing with the material … It’s very unscientific but that’s also the point of putting it into such a geometric form.[^Lewis]

Many data artists are responding to an increasingly data-saturated culture. ~~I notices a general theme that surfaced in my peer’s projects.~~

Another reflection on data as a sinful reflection of self is made by Laurie Frick. She proclaims to be an artist who makes art based on the future of personal data. “We’ve got from completely mysterious, to completely known.” Thew question is by whom, is someone else but ourself? But Frick found a personal connection with the data she was visualizing. It felt “organic and personal”. When its abstracted and played back in places that we live, it “might be shortcut to mindfulness” or “a technology to post our immune system”. “Maybe our brain cannot tell the difference between meditative self reflection and an intake of a data selfie”.[^Frick2]

> It’s about what these patterns will tell us about ourselves. Perhaps seeing the abstract patterns and rhythms of your own data is a short-cut to mindfulness. A quick and dirty way to boost your immune system, the benefits of meditation and self-reflection without much effort.[^Frick]

What if we can become aware of our bodies systems, the same way we can become aware of the data that highlights inconsistencies. But will our agency over our data be guaranteed, or while there always be someone who uses the data to a bigger advantage but us?
